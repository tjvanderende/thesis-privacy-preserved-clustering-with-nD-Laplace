\section{Research questions}
\textbf{Main question}: \newline
\textit{How can the nD-Laplace algorithm be applied in training privacy-preserving clustering algorithms on distributed n-dimensional data?}


\begin{enumerate}
  \item RQ1: How can 2D-Laplace be used to protect the data privacy of 2-dimensional data which is employed for training clustering algorithms?
  \item RQ2: How can 3D-Laplace be extended to protect the data privacy of n-dimensional data which is employed for training clustering algorithms?
  \item RQ3: What is the impact of different privacy budgets, dataset properties, and other clustering algorithms on the research conducted for research question 2?
\end{enumerate}
