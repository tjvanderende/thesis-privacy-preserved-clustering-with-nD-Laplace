\chapter{Methodology}

To gain insights into the proposed methods for researching the appliance of (ND)-Laplace for cluster algorithms we conducted experiments.
The experiment results are used to evaluate our method against other literature.
In this chapter we explain:
\begin{enumerate}

  \item Datasets
  \item Environmental setup.
  \item For each research question: Description of the different experiments.
  \item For each research question: Results.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Datasets}
For this research, we will use a synthetic dataset for all three research questions.
% Please add the following required packages to your document preamble:
% \usepackage{booktabs}
\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{tabular}{@{}lllll@{}}
    \toprule
    Records & Centers & Dimensions & Standard deviation & Research \\ \midrule
    200     & 4       & 2          & 0.60               & RQ 1     \\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Research question 3 uses a "real-world" dataset to properly assess the different dataset properties that are the subject of this research question.
