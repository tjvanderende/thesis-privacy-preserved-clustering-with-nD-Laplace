\section{Big O Notation} \label{theory:big-o}
The big O notation is a common way to describe the complexity of an algorithm.
It is used to describe the worst-case scenario of an algorithm.
For example, if an algorithm has a complexity of $O(n)$, it means that the algorithm will take at most $n$ steps to complete.
Below, this is illustrated using a graph.
