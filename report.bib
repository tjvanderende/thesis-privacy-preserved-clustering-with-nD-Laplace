  abstract = {In many data analysis tasks, one is often confronted with very high dimensional data. Feature selection techniques are designed to find the relevant feature subset of the original features which can facilitate clustering, classification and retrieval. In this paper, we consider the feature selection problem in unsupervised learning scenario, which is particularly difficult due to the absence of class labels that would guide the search for relevant information. The feature selection problem is essentially a combinatorial optimization problem which is computationally expensive. Traditional unsupervised feature selection methods address this issue by selecting the top ranked features based on certain scores computed independently for each feature. These approaches neglect the possible correlation between different features and thus can not produce an optimal feature subset. Inspired from the recent developments on manifold learning and L1-regularized models for subset selection, we propose in this paper a new approach, called Multi-Cluster Feature Selection (MCFS), for unsupervised feature selection. Specifically, we select those features such that the multi-cluster structure of the data can be best preserved. The corresponding optimization problem can be efficiently solved since it only involves a sparse eigen-problem and a L1-regularized least squares problem. Extensive experimental results over various real-life data sets have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {Location-based apps provide users with personalized services tailored to their geographical position. This is highly-beneficial for mobile users, who are able to find points of interest close to their location, or connect with nearby friends. However, sharing location data with service providers also introduces privacy concerns. An adversary with access to fine-grained user locations can infer private details about individuals. Geo-indistinguishability (GeoInd) adapts the popular differential privacy (DP) model to make it suitable for protecting users' location information. However, existing techniques that implement GeoInd have major drawbacks. Some solutions, such as the planar Laplace mechanism, significantly lower data utility by adding excessive noise. Other approaches, such as the optimal mechanism, achieve good utility, but only work for small sets of candidate locations due to the use of computationally-expensive linear programming. In most cases, locations are used to answer online queries, so a quick response time is essential. In this paper, we propose a technique that achieves GeoInd and scales to large datasets while preserving data utility. Our central idea is to use the composability property of GeoInd to create a multiple-step algorithm that can be used in conjunction with a spatial index. We preserve utility by applying accurate GeoInd mechanisms and we achieve scalability by pruning the solution search space with the help of the index when seeking high-utility outcomes. Our extensive performance evaluation on top of real location datasets from social media apps shows that the proposed technique outperforms significantly the benchmark in terms of utility and/or computational overhead.},

  abstract = {In supervised learning scenarios, feature selection has been studied widely in the literature. Selecting features in unsupervised learning scenarios is a much harder problem, due to the absence of class labels that would guide the search for relevant information. And, almost all of previous unsupervised feature selection methods are "wrapper" techniques that require a learning algorithm to evaluate the candidate feature subsets. In this paper, we propose a "filter" method for feature selection which is independent of any learning algorithm. Our method can be performed in either supervised or unsupervised fashion. The proposed method is based on the observation that, in many real world classification problems, data from the same class are often close to each other. The importance of a feature is evaluated by its power of locality preserving, or, Laplacian Score. We compare our method with data variance (unsupervised) and Fisher score (supervised) on two data sets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.},

  abstract = {In the feature subset selection problem, a learning algorithm is faced with the problem of selecting a relevant subset of features upon which to focus its attention, while ignoring the rest. To achieve the best possible performance with a particular learning algorithm on a particular training set, a feature subset selection method should consider how the algorithm and the training set interact. We explore the relation between optimal feature subset selection and relevance. Our wrapper method searches for an optimal feature subset tailored to a particular algorithm and a domain. We study the strengths and weaknesses of the wrapper approach and show a series of improved designs. We compare the wrapper approach to induction without feature subset selection and to Relief, a filter approach to feature subset selection. Significant improvement in accuracy is achieved for some datasets for the two families of induction algorithms used: decision trees and Naive-Bayes.},

It is closely related to the logarithmic function and arises from many models in the natural sciences, including a surprising number of problems in ecology and evolution. I describe the basic properties of the function and present examples of its application to models of ecological and evolutionary processes. The Lambert W function makes it possible to solve explicitly several models where this is not possible with elementary functions. I present examples of such models from existing literature, as well as novel models. Solving models explicitly with the Lambert W function can provide deeper insight and a new point of view on a biological problem. Explicit solutions with the Lambert W function are easily amenable to further mathematical operations, such as differentiation and integration. These advantages apply to a wide range of models, from the marginal value theorem to population growth rates and disease epidemics.},

The superiority of the algorithm, in terms of speed and performance, is established extensively over various real-life data sets of different sizes and dimensions. It is also demonstrated how redundancy and information loss in feature selection can be quantified with an entropy measure.},

A problem with most of these follow-up works is that they blindly rely on geo-indistinguishability to provide location privacy, ignoring the numerical interpretation of this privacy guarantee. In this paper we provide an alternative formulation of geo-indistinguishability as an adversary error, and use it to show that the privacy vs. utility trade-off that can be obtained is not as appealing as implied by the literature. We also show that although geo-indistinguishability guarantees a lower bound on the adversary's error, this comes at the cost of achieving poorer performance than other noise generation mechanisms in terms of average error, and enabling the possibility of exposing obfuscated locations that are useless from the quality of service point of view.},

  abstract = {Information theoretic measures form a fundamental class of measures for comparing clusterings, and have recently received increasing interest. Nevertheless, a number of questions concerning their properties and inter-relationships remain unresolved. In this paper, we perform an organized study of information theoretic measures for clustering comparison, including several existing popular measures in the literature, as well as some newly proposed ones. We discuss and prove their important properties, such as the metric property and the normalization property. We then highlight to the clustering community the importance of correcting information theoretic measures for chance, especially when the data size is small compared to the number of clusters present therein. Of the available information theoretic based measures, we advocate the normalized information distance (NID) as a general measure of choice, for it possesses concurrently several important properties, such as being both a metric and a normalized measure, admitting an exact analytical adjusted-for-chance form, and using the nominal [0, 1] range better than other normalized variants.},

  abstract = {Location-based services (LBS) are capable of providing location-based information retrieval, traffic navigation, entertainment services, emergency rescues, and several similar services primarily on the premise of the geographic location of users or mobile devices. However, in the process of introducing a new user experience, it is also easy to expose users' specific location which can result in more private information leakage. Hence, the protection of location privacy remains one of the critical issues of the location-based services. Moreover, the areas where humans work and live have different location semantics and sensitivities according to their different social functions. Although the privacy protection of a user's real location can be achieved by the perturbation algorithm, the attackers may employ the semantics information of the perturbed location to infer a user's real location semantics in an attempt to spy on a user's privacy to certain extent. In order to mitigate the above semantics inference attack, and further improve the quality of the location-based services, this paper hereby proposes a user side location perturbation and optimization algorithm based on geo-indistinguishability and location semantics. The perturbation area satisfying geo-indistinguishability is thus generated according to the planar Laplace mechanism and optimized by combining the semantics information and time characteristics of the location. The optimum perturbed location that is able to satisfy the minimum loss of location-based service quality is selected via a linear programming method, and can be employed to replace the real location of the user so as to prevent the leakage of the privacy. Experimental comparison of the actual road network and location semantics dataset manifests that the proposed method reduces approximately 37\% perturbation distance in contrast to the other state-of-the-art methods, maintains considerably lower similarity of location semantics, and improves region counting query accuracy by a margin of around 40\%.},
