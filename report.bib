Nevertheless, serious privacy leakage concerns are stumbling blocks impeding its widespread application. To quantify the privacy of small and large-scale interval data, we introduce two notions of \&amp;\#x03B1;-Condensed Local Differential Privacy and \&amp;\#x03F5;-Local Differential Privacy, and propose two distance-aware perturbation mechanisms of \&amp;\#x03B1;-exponential and square wave mechanisms. Rigorous theoretical analysis proves that our proposed mechanisms satisfy these two privacy notions.

  abstract = {Local differential privacy (LPD) is a distributed variant of differential privacy (DP) in which the obfuscation of the sensitive information is done at the level of the individual records, and in general it is used to sanitize data that are collected for statistical purposes. LPD has the advantage it does not need to assume a trusted third party. On the other hand LDP in general requires more noise than DP to achieve the same level of protection, with negative consequences on the utility. In practice, utility becomes acceptable only on very large collections of data, and this is the reason why LDP is especially successful among big companies such as Apple and Google, which can count on a huge number of users. In this paper, we propose a variant of LDP suitable for metric spaces, such as location data or energy consumption data, and we show that it provides a much better utility for the same level of privacy.},

In this work, we investigate privacy-preserving density-based clustering which is, for example, used in financial analytics and medical diagnosis. When (multiple) data owners collaborate or outsource the computation, privacy concerns arise. To address this problem, we design, implement, and evaluate the first practical and fully private density-based clustering scheme based on secure two-party computation. Our protocol privately executes the DBSCAN algorithm without disclosing any information (including the number and size of clusters). It can be used for private clustering between two parties as well as for private outsourcing of an arbitrary number of data owners to two non-colluding servers. Our implementation of the DBSCAN algorithm privately clusters data sets with 400 elements in 7 minutes on commodity hardware. Thereby, it flexibly determines the number of required clusters and is insensitive to outliers, while being only factor 19x slower than today's fastest private K-means protocol (Mohassel et al., PETS'20) which can only be used for specific data sets. We then show how to transfer our newly designed protocol to related clustering algorithms by introducing a private approximation of the TRACLUS algorithm for trajectory clustering which has interesting real-world applications like financial time series forecasts and the investigation of the spread of a disease like COVID-19.},

Furthermore, we present current research circumstances on LDP including the private statistical learning/inferencing, private statistical data analysis, privacy amplification techniques for LDP, and some application fields under LDP. Finally, we identify future research directions and open challenges for LDP. This survey can serve as a good reference source for the research of LDP to deal with various privacy-related scenarios to be encountered in practice.}

Data heterogeneity in FL makes the data non-IID (Non-Independent and Identically Distributed). We use a novel approach to create non-IID partitions of data by solving an optimization problem. In this work, each device trains a decision tree classifier. Devices share the root node of their trees with the aggregator. The aggregator merges the trees by choosing the most common split attribute and grows the branches based on the split values of the chosen split attribute. This recursive process stops when all the nodes to be merged are leaf nodes. After the merging operation, the aggregator sends the merged decision tree to the distributed devices. Therefore, we aim to build a joint machine learning model based on the data from multiple devices while offering k-anonymity to the participants.},

In this work, we target privacy-preserving collaborative hierarchical clustering. We introduce a formal security definition that aims to achieve the balance between utility and privacy and present a two-party protocol that provably satisfies it. We then extend our protocol with: (i) an optimized version for the single-linkage clustering, and (ii) scalable approximation variants. We implement all our schemes and experimentally evaluate their performance and accuracy on synthetic and real datasets, obtaining very encouraging results. For example, end-to-end execution of our secure approximate protocol for over 1M 10-dimensional data samples requires 35sec of computation and achieves 97.09\% accuracy.},

While geo-spatial data contains sensitive information about personal activities, collecting it in its raw form may lead to the leak of personal information relating to the people, violating their privacy. This paper proposes a novel privacy-aware framework for aggregating the indoor location data employing the Local Differential Privacy (LDP) technique, in which the user location data is changed locally in the user's device and is sent to the aggregator afterward. Therefore, the users' locations are kept hidden from a server or any attackers. The practical feasibility of applying the proposed framework is verified by two real-world datasets. The impact of dataset properties, the privacy mechanisms, and the privacy level on our framework are also investigated. The experimental results indicate that the presented framework can protect the location information of users, and the accuracy of the population frequency of different zones in the indoor area is close to that of the original population frequency with no knowledge about the location of people indoors.},

  abstract = {Recommendation systems rely heavily on users behavioural and preferential data (e.g. ratings, likes) to produce accurate recommendations. However, users experience privacy concerns due to unethical data aggregation and analytical practices carried out by the Service Providers (SP). Local differential privacy (LDP) based perturbation mechanisms add noise to users data at user side before sending it to the SP. The SP then uses the perturbed data to perform recommendations. Although LDP protects the privacy of users from SP, it causes a substantial decline in predictive accuracy. To address this issue, we propose an LDP-based Matrix Factorization (MF) with a Gaussian Mixture Model (MoG). The LDP perturbation mechanism, Bounded Laplace (BLP), regulates the effect of noise by confining the perturbed ratings to a predetermined domain. We derive a sufficient condition of the scale parameter for BLP to satisfy \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ LDP. At the SP, The MoG model estimates the noise added to perturbed ratings and the MF algorithm predicts missing ratings. Our proposed LDP based recommendation system improves the recommendation accuracy without violating LDP principles. The empirical evaluations carried out on three real world datasets, i.e., Movielens, Libimseti and Jester, demonstrate that our method offers a substantial increase in predictive accuracy under strong privacy guarantee.},

As machine learning, federated learning is threatened by adversarial attacks against the integrity of the learning model and the privacy of data via a distributed approach to tackle local and global learning. This weak point is exacerbated by the inaccessibility of data in federated learning, which makes harder the protection against adversarial attacks and evidences the need to furtherance the research on defence methods to make federated learning a real solution for safeguarding data privacy. In this paper, we present an extensive review of the threats of federated learning, as well as as their corresponding countermeasures, attacks versus defences. This survey provides a taxonomy of adversarial attacks and a taxonomy of defence methods that depict a general picture of this vulnerability of federated learning and how to overcome it. Likewise, we expound guidelines for selecting the most adequate defence method according to the category of the adversarial attack. Besides, we carry out an extensive experimental study from which we draw further conclusions about the behaviour of attacks and defences and the guidelines for selecting the most adequate defence method according to the category of the adversarial attack.

A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to kanonymity unless accompanying policies are respected.

  abstract = {This paper presents LDP-Fed, a novel federated learning system with a formal privacy guarantee using local differential privacy (LDP). Existing LDP protocols are developed primarily to ensure data privacy in the collection of single numerical or categorical values, such as click count in Web access logs. However, in federated learning model parameter updates are collected iteratively from each participant and consist of high dimensional, continuous values with high precision (10s of digits after the decimal point), making existing LDP protocols inapplicable. To address this challenge in LDP-Fed, we design and develop two novel approaches. First, LDP-Fed's LDP Module provides a formal differential privacy guarantee for the repeated collection of model training parameters in the federated training of large-scale neural networks over multiple individual participants' private datasets. Second, LDP-Fed implements a suite of selection and filtering techniques for perturbing and sharing select parameter updates with the parameter server. We validate our system deployed with a condensed LDP protocol in training deep neural networks on public data. We compare this version of LDP-Fed, coined CLDP-Fed, with other state-of-the-art approaches with respect to model accuracy, privacy preservation, and system capabilities.},

  abstract = {In many cases, a service provider might require to aggregate data from end-users to perform mining tasks such as K-means clustering. Nevertheless, since such data often contain sensitive information. In this paper, we propose the first locally differentially private K-means mechanism under this distributed scenario. Differing from standard differentially private clustering mechanisms, the proposed mechanism doesn't need any trusted third party to collect and preprocess users data. Our mechanism first perturbs users data locally to satisfy local differential privacy~(LDP). Then it revises the traditional K-means algorithm to allow the service provider to obtain high-quality clustering results by collaborating with users based on the highly perturbed data. We prove that our mechanism can enable high utility clustering while guaranteeing local differential privacy for each user. We also propose an extended mechanism to improve our basic model in terms of privacy and utility. In this mechanism, we perturb both users' sensitive data and the intermediate results of users' clusters in each iteration. Moreover, we consider a more general setting where the users may have different privacy requirements. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets, and the results show that our proposal can well preserve the quality of clustering results.},

  abstract = {Location-based services (LBS) are capable of providing location-based information retrieval, traffic navigation, entertainment services, emergency rescues, and several similar services primarily on the premise of the geographic location of users or mobile devices.

Hence, the protection of location privacy remains one of the critical issues of the location-based services. Moreover, the areas where humans work and live have different location semantics and sensitivities according to their different social functions. Although the privacy protection of a user's real location can be achieved by the perturbation algorithm, the attackers may employ the semantics information of the perturbed location to infer a user's real location semantics in an attempt to spy on a user's privacy to certain extent. In order to mitigate the above semantics inference attack, and further improve the quality of the location-based services, this paper hereby proposes a user side location perturbation and optimization algorithm based on geo-indistinguishability and location semantics. The perturbation area satisfying geo-indistinguishability is thus generated according to the planar Laplace mechanism and optimized by combining the semantics information and time characteristics of the location. The optimum perturbed location that is able to satisfy the minimum loss of location-based service quality is selected via a linear programming method, and can be employed to replace the real location of the user so as to prevent the leakage of the privacy. Experimental comparison of the actual road network and location semantics dataset manifests that the proposed method reduces approximately 37\% perturbation distance in contrast to the other state-of-the-art methods, maintains considerably lower similarity of location semantics, and improves region counting query accuracy by a margin of around 40\%.}

  abstract = {With the fast development of Information Technology, a tremendous amount of data have been generated and collected for research and analysis purposes. As an increasing number of users are growing concerned about their personal information, privacy preservation has become an urgent problem to be solved and has attracted significant attention. Local differential privacy (LDP), as a strong privacy tool, has been widely deployed in the real world in recent years. It breaks the shackles of the trusted third party, and allows users to perturb their data locally, thus providing much stronger privacy protection. This survey provides a comprehensive and structured overview of the local differential privacy technology. We summarise and analyze state-of-the-art research in LDP and compare a range of methods in the context of answering a variety of queries and training different machine learning models. We discuss the practical deployment of local differential privacy and explore its application in various domains. Furthermore, we point out several research gaps, and discuss promising future research directions.},
