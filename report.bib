In this paper, we investigate how the privacy goal that the inclusion of one's location history in a statistical database with location pattern mining capabilities does not substantially increase one's privacy risk. In particular, we propose a differentially private pattern mining algorithm for interesting geographic location discovery using a region quadtree spatial decomposition to preprocess the location points followed by applying a density-based clustering algorithm. A differentially private region quadtree is used for both de-noising the spatial domain and identifying the likely geographic regions containing the interesting locations. Then, a differential privacy mechanism is applied to the algorithm outputs, namely: the interesting regions and their corresponding stay point counts. The quadtree spatial decomposition enables one to obtain a localized reduced sensitivity to achieve the differential privacy goal and accurate outputs. Experimental results on synthetic datasets are used to show the feasibility of the proposed privacy preserving location pattern mining algorithm.},

In this work, we investigate privacy-preserving density-based clustering which is, for example, used in financial analytics and medical diagnosis. When (multiple) data owners collaborate or outsource the computation, privacy concerns arise. To address this problem, we design, implement, and evaluate the first practical and fully private density-based clustering scheme based on secure two-party computation. Our protocol privately executes the DBSCAN algorithm without disclosing any information (including the number and size of clusters). It can be used for private clustering between two parties as well as for private outsourcing of an arbitrary number of data owners to two non-colluding servers. Our implementation of the DBSCAN algorithm privately clusters data sets with 400 elements in 7 minutes on commodity hardware. Thereby, it flexibly determines the number of required clusters and is insensitive to outliers, while being only factor 19x slower than today's fastest private K-means protocol (Mohassel et al., PETS'20) which can only be used for specific data sets. We then show how to transfer our newly designed protocol to related clustering algorithms by introducing a private approximation of the TRACLUS algorithm for trajectory clustering which has interesting real-world applications like financial time series forecasts and the investigation of the spread of a disease like COVID-19.},

In this paper, we study the problem of publishing set-valued data for data mining tasks under the rigorous differential privacy model. All existing data publishing methods for set-valued data are based on partition-based privacy models, for example k-anonymity, which are vulnerable to privacy attacks based on background knowledge. In contrast, differential privacy provides strong privacy guarantees independent of an adversary's background knowledge and computational power. Existing data publishing approaches for differential privacy, however, are not adequate in terms of both utility and scalability in the context of set-valued data due to its high dimensionality.We demonstrate that set-valued data could be efficiently released under differential privacy with guaranteed utility with the help of context-free taxonomy trees. We propose a probabilistic top-down partitioning algorithm to generate a differentially private release, which scales linearly with the input data size. We also discuss the applicability of our idea to the context of relational data. We prove that our result is ({$\in$}, {$\delta$})-useful for the class of counting queries, the foundation of many data mining tasks. We show that our approach maintains high utility for counting queries and frequent itemset mining and scales to large datasets through extensive experiments on real-life set-valued datasets.},

  abstract = {Principal component analysis (pca) is a multivariate technique that analyzes a data table in which observations are described by several inter-correlated quantitative dependent variables. Its goal is to extract the important information from the table, to represent it as a set of new orthogonal variables called principal components, and to display the pattern of similarity of the observations and of the variables as points in maps. The quality of the pca model can be evaluated using cross-validation techniques such as the bootstrap and the jackknife. Pca can be generalized as correspondence analysis (ca) in order to handle qualitative variables and as multiple factor analysis (mfa) in order to handle heterogenous sets of variables. Mathematically, pca depends upon the eigen-decomposition of positive semi-definite matrices and upon the singular value decomposition (svd) of rectangular matrices.}

However, despite its popularity, the algorithm has certain limitations, including problems associated with random initialization of the centroids which leads to unexpected convergence. Additionally, such a clustering algorithm requires the number of clusters to be defined beforehand, which is responsible for different cluster shapes and outlier effects. A fundamental problem of the k-means algorithm is its inability to handle various data types. This paper provides a structured and synoptic overview of research conducted on the k-means algorithm to overcome such shortcomings. Variants of the k-means algorithms including their recent developments are discussed, where their effectiveness is investigated based on the experimental analysis of a variety of datasets. The detailed experimental analysis along with a thorough comparison among different k-means clustering algorithms differentiates our work compared to other existing survey papers. Furthermore, it outlines a clear and thorough understanding of the k-means algorithm along with its different research directions.},

This is highly-beneficial for mobile users, who are able to find points of interest close to their location, or connect with nearby friends. However, sharing location data with service providers also introduces privacy concerns. An adversary with access to fine-grained user locations can infer private details about individuals. Geo-indistinguishability (GeoInd) adapts the popular differential privacy (DP) model to make it suitable for protecting users' location information. However, existing techniques that implement GeoInd have major drawbacks. Some solutions, such as the planar Laplace mechanism, significantly lower data utility by adding excessive noise. Other approaches, such as the optimal mechanism, achieve good utility, but only work for small sets of candidate locations due to the use of computationally-expensive linear programming. In most cases, locations are used to answer online queries, so a quick response time is essential. In this paper, we propose a technique that achieves GeoInd and scales to large datasets while preserving data utility. Our central idea is to use the composability property of GeoInd to create a multiple-step algorithm that can be used in conjunction with a spatial index. We preserve utility by applying accurate GeoInd mechanisms and we achieve scalability by pruning the solution search space with the help of the index when seeking high-utility outcomes. Our extensive performance evaluation on top of real location datasets from social media apps shows that the proposed technique outperforms significantly the benchmark in terms of utility and/or computational overhead.},

This paper is concerned with the development and application of automatic clustering of Entity-Relationship (E-R) diagrams and object models. This paper does not consider physical clustering which aims at improving performance of databases but deals with conceptual clustering whose objective is to facilitate the understanding of the database schema. We provide an automatization of conceptual schema clustering leading to a unification of past approaches. Automatization is achieved through the definition of semantic distances between concepts and the use of a clustering algorithm. For entity-relationship clustering, we define three different distances (visual, hierarchical and cohesive) depending on the semantic richness. Object model clustering is based on structural, semantic and communication characteristics of objects. Our approach has been implemented and applied to a great number of examples, leading to interesting results. Applications of automatic clustering in several areas and their potential as a communication, documentation and design tools for E-R diagrams and obiect oriented models are described and discussed.},

  abstract = {The accelerating progress of network speed, reliability and security creates an increasing demand to move software and services from being stored and processed locally on users' machines to being managed by third parties that are accessible through the network. This has created the need to develop new software development methods and software architectural styles that meet these new demands. One such example in software architectural design is the recent emergence of the microservices architecture to address the maintenance and scalability demands of online service providers. As microservice architecture is a new research area, the need for a systematic mapping study is crucial in order to summarise the progress so far and identify the gaps and requirements for future studies. In this paper we present a systematic mapping study of microservices architectures and their implementation. Our study focuses on identifying architectural challenges, the architectural diagrams/views and quality attributes related to microsevice systems.},

  abstract = {A wide variety of software metrics have been proposed and a broad range of tools is available to measure them. However, the effective use of software metrics is hindered by the lack of meaningful thresholds. Thresholds have been proposed for a few metrics only, mostly based on expert opinion and a small number of observations. Previously proposed methodologies for systematically deriving metric thresholds have made unjustified assumptions about the statistical properties of source code metrics. As a result, the general applicability of the derived thresholds is jeopardized. We designed a method that determines metric thresholds empirically from measurement data. The measurement data for different software systems are pooled and aggregated after which thresholds are selected that (i) bring out the metric's variability between systems and (ii) help focus on a reasonable percentage of the source code volume. Our method respects the distributions and scales of source code metrics, and it is resilient against outliers in metric values or system size. We applied our method to a benchmark of 100 object-oriented software systems, both proprietary and open-source, to derive thresholds for metrics included in the SIG maintainability model.},

  abstract = {Cluster analysis is a primary method for database mining. It is either used as a stand-alone tool to get insight into the distribution of a data set, e.g. to focus further analysis and data processing, or as a preprocessing step for other algorithms operating on the detected clusters. Almost all of the well-known clustering algorithms require input parameters which are hard to determine but have a significant influence on the clustering result. Furthermore, for many real-data sets there does not even exist a global parameter setting for which the result of the clustering algorithm describes the intrinsic clustering structure accurately. We introduce a new algorithm for the purpose of cluster analysis which does not produce a clustering of a data set explicitly; but instead creates an augmented ordering of the database representing its density-based clustering structure. This cluster-ordering contains information which is equivalent to the density-based clusterings corresponding to a broad range of parameter settings. It is a versatile basis for both automatic and interactive cluster analysis. We show how to automatically and efficiently extract not only `traditional' clustering information (e.g. representative points, arbitrary shaped clusters), but also the intrinsic clustering structure. For medium sized data sets, the cluster-ordering can be represented graphically and for very large data sets, we introduce an appropriate visualization technique. Both are suitable for interactive exploration of the intrinsic clustering structure offering additional insights into the distribution and correlation of the data.},

PaaS provides preconfigured capabilities like, programming languages, supported frameworks, hosting and runtime environments, application development tools, and database servers managed for developing web applications as well as mobile applications. For an organization, selection of PaaS provider is a crucial task. Since PaaS providers offer a variety of development and deployment features, it becomes difficult to select from among them. Also, the organization may get locked to a particular provider and it is not easy to migrate to a different provider due to legal constraints and technical incompatibilities. In this paper, we present a study of currently available PaaS offerings. We identify the important PaaS characteristics that must be assessed before selecting a PaaS offering. We present a comparative study of different PaaS providers on basis of the identified characteristics. Our study benefits enterprise architects, IT managers and development teams to select PaaS offering best suited to their requirements.}

In this paper we revisit the Gaussian mechanism and show that the original analysis has several important limitations. Our analysis reveals that the variance formula for the original mechanism is far from tight in the high privacy regime (\$\textbackslash varepsilon \textbackslash to 0\$) and it cannot be extended to the low privacy regime (\$\textbackslash varepsilon \textbackslash to \textbackslash infty\$). We address these limitations by developing an optimal Gaussian mechanism whose variance is calibrated directly using the Gaussian cumulative density function instead of a tail bound approximation. We also propose to equip the Gaussian mechanism with a post-processing step based on adaptive estimation techniques by leveraging that the distribution of the perturbation is known. Our experiments show that analytical calibration removes at least a third of the variance of the noise compared to the classical Gaussian mechanism, and that denoising dramatically improves the accuracy of the Gaussian mechanism in the high-dimensional regime.},

  abstract = {Objective: To determine whether the body mass index (BMI) threshold defined for obesity (30kg/m2) adequately reflects risk in an Aboriginal community with a high rate of Type 2 diabetes. Methods: Data about five diabetes risk factors (age, BMI, waist circumference (WC), hypertension and family history) and fasting glucose (FG) were obtained from a random sample of 117 Aboriginal adults (62 women and 55 men) never diagnosed with diabetes. Linear regression between BMI, WC and FG, and sensitivity and specificity analyses in predicting elevated FG and hypertension were conducted. Results: BMI{$\geq$}30kg/m2 and central obesity assessed by WC (women{$\geq$}88cm; men{$\geq$}102cm) were strongly and positively associated. Among women, central obesity was near universal, occurring at BMIs below the `healthy' range of 20-25. WC was linearly associated with other diabetes risk factors. WC{$\geq$}88cm was more sensitive but less specific than BMI{$\geq$}30 in predicting elevated FG and hypertension among women, while BMI{$\geq$}25 among men tended to be both more sensitive and more specific than both BMI{$\geq$}30 and WC{$\geq$}102cm. Conclusions: In women, central obesity is a better predictor of diabetes and CVD risk than BMI{$\geq$}30, which is not a reliable indicator. BMI{$\geq$}25 was a good predictor in men. Implications: BMI is a useful clinical tool to identify individuals at risk, but to be relevant the guidelines defining risk may need to be reduced for the Aboriginal population. For women, a BMI{$\geq$}25 could more adequately reflect risk, while the current WC of 88cm remains appropriate. For men, a reduction in both BMI to {$\geq$}25 and WC to 90cm may better reflect diabetes and CVD risk.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, machine learning models and applications have become increasingly pervasive. With this rapid increase in the development and employment of machine learning models, a concern regarding privacy has risen. Thus, there is a legitimate need to protect the data from leaking and from any attacks. One of the strongest and most prevalent privacy models that can be used to protect machine learning models from any attacks and vulnerabilities is differential privacy (DP). DP is strict and rigid definition of privacy, where it can guarantee that an adversary is not capable to reliably predict if a specific participant is included in the dataset or not. It works by injecting a noise to the data whether to the inputs, the outputs, the ground truth labels, the objective functions, or even to the gradients to alleviate the privacy issue and protect the data. To this end, this survey paper presents different differentially private machine learning algorithms categorized into two main categories (traditional machine learning models vs. deep learning models). Moreover, future research directions for differential privacy with machine learning algorithms are outlined.},

In this model, individual users randomize their data themselves, sending differentially private reports to an untrusted server that aggregates them. We study protocols that produce a succinct histogram representation of the data. A succinct histogram is a list of the most frequent items in the data (often called "heavy hitters") along with estimates of their frequencies; the frequency of all other items is implicitly estimated as 0. If there are \$n\$ users whose items come from a universe of size \$d\$, our protocols run in time polynomial in \$n\$ and \$\textbackslash log(d)\$. With high probability, they estimate the accuracy of every item up to error \$O\textbackslash left(\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash log(d)/(\textbackslash epsilon\^2n)\}\textbackslash right)\$ where \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ is the privacy parameter. Moreover, we show that this much error is necessary, regardless of computational efficiency, and even for the simple setting where only one item appears with significant frequency in the data set. Previous protocols (Mishra and Sandler, 2006; Hsu, Khanna and Roth, 2012) for this task either ran in time \$\textbackslash Omega(d)\$ or had much worse error (about \$\textbackslash sqrt[6]\{\textbackslash log(d)/(\textbackslash epsilon\^2n)\}\$), and the only known lower bound on error was \$\textbackslash Omega(1/\textbackslash sqrt\{n\})\$. We also adapt a result of McGregor et al (2010) to the local setting. In a model with public coins, we show that each user need only send 1 bit to the server. For all known local protocols (including ours), the transformation preserves computational efficiency.},

The k-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an n record file are: insertion, O(log n); deletion of the root, O(n(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, O(log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), O(n log n). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with t keys specified [proven maximum running time of O(n(k-t)/k)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of O(log n).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given.},

In this paper, we investigate the security guarantees provided by Keyless SSL, a CDN architecture currently deployed by CloudFlare that composes two TLS 1.2 handshakes to obtain a proxied TLS connection. We demonstrate new attacks that show that Keyless SSL does not meet its intended security goals. These attacks have been reported to CloudFlare and we are in the process of discussing fixes. We argue that proxied TLS handshakes require a new, stronger, 3-party security definition. We present 3(S)ACCEsecurity, a generalization of the 2-party ACCE security definition that has been used in several previous proofs for TLS. We modify Keyless SSL and prove that our modifications guarantee 3(S)ACCE-security, assuming ACCE-security for the individual TLS 1.2 connections. We also propose a new design for Keyless TLS 1.3 and prove that it achieves 3(S)ACCEsecurity, assuming that the TLS 1.3 handshake implements an authenticated 2-party key exchange. Notably, we show that secure proxying in Keyless TLS 1.3 is computationally lighter and requires simpler assumptions on the certificate infrastructure than our proposed fix for Keyless SSL. Our results indicate that proxied TLS architectures, as currently used by a number of CDNs, may be vulnerable to subtle attacks and deserve close attention.},

  abstract = {Several decades of research in the field of machine learning have resulted in a multitude of different algorithms for solving a broad range of problems. To tackle a new application, a researcher typically tries to map their problem onto one of these existing methods, often influenced by their familiarity with specific algorithms and by the availability of corresponding software implementations. In this study, we describe an alternative methodology for applying machine learning, in which a bespoke solution is formulated for each new application. The solution is expressed through a compact modelling language, and the corresponding custom machine learning code is then generated automatically. This model-based approach offers several major advantages, including the opportunity to create highly tailored models for specific scenarios, as well as rapid prototyping and comparison of a range of alternative models. Furthermore, newcomers to the field of machine learning do not have to learn about the huge range of traditional methods, but instead can focus their attention on understanding a single modelling environment. In this study, we show how probabilistic graphical models, coupled with efficient inference algorithms, provide a very flexible foundation for model-based machine learning, and we outline a large-scale commercial application of this framework involving tens of millions of users. We also describe the concept of probabilistic programming as a powerful software environment for model-based machine learning, and we discuss a specific probabilistic programming language called Infer.NET, which has been widely used in practical applications.},

  abstract = {The discrete logarithm problem plays a central role in cryptographic protocols and computational number theory. To establish the exact complexity, not only of the discrete logarithm problem but also of its relatives, the Diffie\textendash Hellman (DH) problem and the decision DH problem, is of some importance. These problems can be set in a variety of groups, and in some of these they can assume different characteristics. This work considers the bit complexity of the DH and the decision DH problems. It was previously shown by Boneh and Venkatesan that it is as hard to compute O(n) of the most significant bits of the DH function, as it is to compute the whole function, implying that if the DH function is difficult then so is computing this number of bits of it. The main result of this paper is to show that if the decision DH problem is hard then computing the two most significant bits of the DH function is hard. To place the result in perspective a brief overview of relevant recent advances on related problems is given.},

  abstract = {"...this edition is useful and effective in teaching Bayesian inference at both elementary and intermediate levels. It is a well-written book on elementary Bayesian inference, and the material is easily accessible. It is both concise and timely, and provides a good collection of overviews and reviews of important tools used in Bayesian statistical methods." There is a strong upsurge in the use of Bayesian methods in applied statistical analysis, yet most introductory statistics texts only present frequentist methods. Bayesian statistics has many important advantages that students should learn about if they are going into fields where statistics will be used. In this third Edition, four newly-added chapters address topics that reflect the rapid advances in the field of Bayesian statistics. The authors continue to provide a Bayesian treatment of introductory statistical topics, such as scientific data gathering, discrete random variables, robust Bayesian methods, and Bayesian approaches to inference for discrete random variables, binomial proportions, Poisson, and normal means, and simple linear regression. In addition, more advanced topics in the field are presented in four new chapters: Bayesian inference for a normal with unknown mean and variance; Bayesian inference for a Multivariate Normal mean vector; Bayesian inference for the Multiple Linear Regression Model; and Computational Bayesian Statistics including Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The inclusion of these topics will facilitate readers' ability to advance from a minimal understanding of Statistics to the ability to tackle topics in more applied, advanced level books. Minitab macros and R functions are available on the book's related website to assist with chapter exercises. Introduction to Bayesian Statistics, Third Edition also features:  Topics including the Joint Likelihood function and inference using independent Jeffreys priors and join conjugate prior The cutting-edge topic of computational Bayesian Statistics in a new chapter, with a unique focus on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods Exercises throughout the book that have been updated to reflect new applications and the latest software applications Detailed appendices that guide readers through the use of R and Minitab software for Bayesian analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, with all related macros available on the book's website  Introduction to Bayesian Statistics, Third Edition is a textbook for upper-undergraduate or first-year graduate level courses on introductory statistics course with a Bayesian emphasis. It can also be used as a reference work for statisticians who require a working knowledge of Bayesian statistics.},

  abstract = {Clustering in high-dimensional spaces is a difficult problem which is recurrent in many domains, for example in image analysis. The difficulty is due to the fact that high-dimensional data usually exist in different low-dimensional subspaces hidden in the original space. A family of Gaussian mixture models designed for high-dimensional data which combine the ideas of subspace clustering and parsimonious modeling are presented. These models give rise to a clustering method based on the expectation\textendash maximization algorithm which is called high-dimensional data clustering (HDDC). In order to correctly fit the data, HDDC estimates the specific subspace and the intrinsic dimension of each group. Experiments on artificial and real data sets show that HDDC outperforms existing methods for clustering high-dimensional data.},

The user marks certain pixels as ``object'' or ``background'' to provide hard constraints for segmentation. Additional soft constraints incorporate both boundary and region information. Graph cuts are used to find the globally optimal segmentation of the N-dimensional image. The obtained solution gives the best balance of boundary and region properties among all segmentations satisfying the constraints. The topology of our segmentation is unrestricted and both ``object'' and ``background'' segments may consist of several isolated parts. Some experimental results are presented in the context of photo/video editing and medical image segmentation. We also demonstrate an interesting Gestalt example. A fast implementation of our segmentation method is possible via a new max-flow algorithm in [2].},

  abstract = {Many machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to almost imperceptible perturbations of their inputs. So far it was unclear how much risk adversarial perturbations carry for the safety of real-world machine learning applications because most methods used to generate such perturbations rely either on detailed model information (gradient-based attacks) or on confidence scores such as class probabilities (score-based attacks), neither of which are available in most real-world scenarios. In many such cases one currently needs to retreat to transfer-based attacks which rely on cumbersome substitute models, need access to the training data and can be defended against. Here we emphasise the importance of attacks which solely rely on the final model decision. Such decision-based attacks are (1) applicable to real-world black-box models such as autonomous cars, (2) need less knowledge and are easier to apply than transfer-based attacks and (3) are more robust to simple defences than gradient- or score-based attacks. Previous attacks in this category were limited to simple models or simple datasets. Here we introduce the Boundary Attack, a decision-based attack that starts from a large adversarial perturbation and then seeks to reduce the perturbation while staying adversarial. The attack is conceptually simple, requires close to no hyperparameter tuning, does not rely on substitute models and is competitive with the best gradient-based attacks in standard computer vision tasks like ImageNet. We apply the attack on two black-box algorithms from Clarifai.com. The Boundary Attack in particular and the class of decision-based attacks in general open new avenues to study the robustness of machine learning models and raise new questions regarding the safety of deployed machine learning systems. An implementation of the attack is available as part of Foolbox at https://github.com/bethgelab/foolbox .},

In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a degree of being an outlier. This degree is called the local outlier factor (LOF) of an object. It is local in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using realworld datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding local outliers can be practical.},

  abstract = {GraphQL is a novel query language for implementing service-based software architectures. The language is gaining momentum and it is now used by major software companies, such as Facebook and GitHub. However, we still lack empirical evidence on the real gains achieved by GraphQL, particularly in terms of the effort required to implement queries in this language. Therefore, in this paper we describe a controlled experiment with 22 students (10 undergraduate and 12 graduate), who were asked to implement eight queries for accessing a web service, using GraphQL and REST. Our results show that GraphQL requires less effort to implement remote service queries when compared to REST (9 vs 6 minutes, median times). These gains increase when REST queries include more complex endpoints, with several parameters. Interestingly, GraphQL outperforms REST even among more experienced participants (as is the case of graduate students) and among participants with previous experience in REST, but no previous experience in GraphQL.},

  abstract = {In many data analysis tasks, one is often confronted with very high dimensional data. Feature selection techniques are designed to find the relevant feature subset of the original features which can facilitate clustering, classification and retrieval. In this paper, we consider the feature selection problem in unsupervised learning scenario, which is particularly difficult due to the absence of class labels that would guide the search for relevant information. The feature selection problem is essentially a combinatorial optimization problem which is computationally expensive. Traditional unsupervised feature selection methods address this issue by selecting the top ranked features based on certain scores computed independently for each feature. These approaches neglect the possible correlation between different features and thus can not produce an optimal feature subset. Inspired from the recent developments on manifold learning and L1regularized models for subset selection, we propose in this paper a new approach, called Multi-Cluster Feature Selection (MCFS), for unsupervised feature selection. Specifically, we select those features such that the multi-cluster structure of the data can be best preserved. The corresponding optimization problem can be efficiently solved since it only involves a sparse eigen-problem and a L1-regularized least squares problem. Extensive experimental results over various real-life data sets have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

We argue that attacks should instead be evaluated by computing their true-positive rate at low (e.g., {$<$}0.1\%) false-positive rates, and find most prior attacks perform poorly when evaluated in this way. To address this we develop a Likelihood Ratio Attack (LiRA) that carefully combines multiple ideas from the literature. Our attack is 10x more powerful at low false-positive rates, and also strictly dominates prior attacks on existing metrics.},

  abstract = {Microservices architecture is increasingly being used to develop application systems since its smaller codebase facilitates faster code development, testing, and deployment as well as optimization of the platform based on the type of microservice, support for independent development teams, and the ability to scale each component independently. Microservices generally communicate with each other using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which requires several core features to support complex interactions between a substantial number of components. These core features include authentication and access management, service discovery, secure communication protocols, security monitoring, availability/resiliency improvement techniques (e.g., circuit breakers), load balancing and throttling, integrity assurance techniques during induction of new services, and handling of session persistence. Additionally, the core features could be bundled or packaged into architectural frameworks such as API gateways and service mesh. The purpose of this document is to analyze the multiple implementation options available for each individual core feature and configuration options in architectural frameworks, develop security strategies that counter threats specific to microservices, and enhance the overall security profile of the microservices-based application.},

  abstract = {With the increasing popularity of hand-held devices, location-based applications and services have access to accurate and real-time location information, raising serious privacy concerns for their users. The recently introduced notion of geo-indistinguishability tries to address this problem by adapting the well-known concept of differential privacy to the area of location-based systems. Although geo-indistinguishability presents various appealing aspects, it has the problem of treating space in a uniform way, imposing the addition of the same amount of noise everywhere on the map. In this paper we propose a novel elastic distinguishability metric that warps the geometrical distance, capturing the different degrees of density of each area. As a consequence, the obtained mechanism adapts the level of noise while achieving the same degree of privacy everywhere. We also show how such an elastic metric can easily incorporate the concept of a "geographic fence" that is commonly employed to protect the highly recurrent locations of a user, such as his home or work. We perform an extensive evaluation of our technique by building an elastic metric for Paris' wide metropolitan area, using semantic information from the OpenStreetMap database. We compare the resulting mechanism against the Planar Laplace mechanism satisfying standard geo-indistinguishability, using two real-world datasets from the Gowalla and Brightkite location-based social networks. The results show that the elastic mechanism adapts well to the semantics of each area, adjusting the noise as we move outside the city center, hence offering better overall privacy.},

Then, aiming at the subjective problem of clustering center selection, from the perspective of ranking graph, the weight \$(i-1)/i\$ was introduced creatively, the slope trend of ranking graph was redefined to realize the adaptive clustering center. Finally, aiming at the privacy problem, the Laplacian noise of appropriate privacy budget was added to the core statistic (local density) of the algorithm to achieve the balance between privacy protection and algorithm effectiveness. Experimental results on both the synthetic and UCI datasets show that this algorithm can not only realize the automatic selection of clustering center, but also solve the privacy problem in clustering analysis, and improve the clustering evaluation index greatly, which proves the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

In contrast, differential privacy provides strong privacy guarantees independent of an adversary's background knowledge and computational power. Existing data publishing approaches for differential privacy, however, are not adequate in terms of both utility and scalability in the context of set-valued data due to its high dimensionality.},

With this review, we present ten quick tips to take advantage of machine learning in any computational biology context, by avoiding some common errors that we observed hundreds of times in multiple bioinformatics projects.

  abstract = {Membership inference attacks are one of the simplest forms of privacy leakage for machine learning models: given a data point and model, determine whether the point was used to train the model. Existing membership inference attacks exploit models' abnormal confidence when queried on their training data. These attacks do not apply if the adversary only gets access to models' predicted labels, without a confidence measure. In this paper, we introduce label-only membership inference attacks. Instead of relying on confidence scores, our attacks evaluate the robustness of a model's predicted labels under perturbations to obtain a fine-grained membership signal. These perturbations include common data augmentations or adversarial examples. We empirically show that our label-only membership inference attacks perform on par with prior attacks that required access to model confidences. We further demonstrate that label-only attacks break multiple defenses against membership inference attacks that (implicitly or explicitly) rely on a phenomenon we call confidence masking. These defenses modify a model's confidence scores in order to thwart attacks, but leave the model's predicted labels unchanged. Our label-only attacks demonstrate that confidence-masking is not a viable defense strategy against membership inference. Finally, we investigate worst-case label-only attacks, that infer membership for a small number of outlier data points. We show that label-only attacks also match confidence-based attacks in this setting. We find that training models with differential privacy and (strong) L2 regularization are the only known defense strategies that successfully prevents all attacks. This remains true even when the differential privacy budget is too high to offer meaningful provable guarantees.},

  abstract = {Recently, significant effort has been made to automate the machine learning process in the context of supervised learning. This automation includes, amongst other things, the selection of an appropriate learning algorithm and corresponding hyperparameters for a particular learning problem. In contrast, such problems are much less studied for unsupervised tasks such as clustering. Nevertheless, users who want to cluster a data set are confronted with similar problems: a clustering algorithm should be selected from the wide variety of available algorithms, and usually some hyperparameters have to be set. In a supervised setting, model search is guided by performance measures that rely on known class labels, such as accuracy. However, these measures are not applicable to clustering as labels are usually not available. Instead, one might use internal validity measures that only rely on properties intrinsic to the data set. Several such measures are defined, and in this paper we study the usefulness of four of them for model selection. We perform experiments with these measures in combination with six clustering algorithms. While some measures are suited to use in hyperparameter optimization for some specific algorithms, we conclude that none of them is suited to compare across very different clustering algorithms.},

The quantum volume is linked to system error rates, and is empirically reduced by uncontrolled interactions within the system. It quantifies the largest random circuit of equal width and depth that the computer successfully implements. Quantum computing systems with high-fidelity operations, high connectivity, large calibrated gate sets, and circuit rewriting toolchains are expected to have higher quantum volumes. The quantum volume is a pragmatic way to measure and compare progress toward improved system-wide gate error rates for near-term quantum computation and error-correction experiments.},

  abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) on a given task. The representation and quality of the instance data is first and foremost. If there is much irrelevant and redundant information present or noisy and unreliable data, then knowledge discovery during the training phase is more difficult. It is well known that data preparation and filtering steps take considerable amount of processing time in ML problems. Data pre-processing includes data cleaning, normalization, transformation, feature extraction and selection, etc. The product of data pre-processing is the final training set. It would be nice if a single sequence of data pre-processing algorithms had the best performance for each data set but this is not happened. Thus, we present the most well know algorithms for each step of data pre-processing so that one achieves the best performance for their data set.

This study tests the performance of machine learning techniques in modeling and predicting occupational incidents severity with respect to accessible information of injured workers in agribusiness industries using workers' compensation claims. More than 33,000 incidents within agribusiness industries in the Midwest of the United States for 2008\textendash 2016 were analyzed. The total cost of incidents was extracted and classified from workers' compensation claims. Supervised machine learning algorithms for classification (support vector machines with linear, quadratic, and RBF kernels, Boosted Trees, and Na\"ive Bayes) were applied. The models can predict injury severity classification based on injured body part, body group, nature of injury, nature group, cause of injury, cause group, and age and tenure of injured workers with the accuracy rate of 92\textendash 98\%. The results emphasize the significance of quantitative analysis of empirical injury data in safety science, and contribute to enhanced understanding of injury patterns using predictive modeling along with safety experts' perspectives with regulatory or managerial viewpoints. The predictive models obtained from this study can be used to augment the experience of safety professionals in agribusiness industries to improve safety intervention efforts.},

Local differential privacy (LDP) is a state-of-the-art privacy preservation technique that allows to perform big data analysis (e.g., statistical estimation, statistical learning, and data mining) while guaranteeing each individual participant\&\#x2019;s privacy. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of LDP. We first give an overview on the fundamental knowledge of LDP and its frameworks. We then introduce the mainstream privatization mechanisms and methods in detail from the perspective of frequency oracle and give insights into recent studied on private basic statistical estimation (e.g., frequency estimation and mean estimation) and complex statistical estimation (e.g., multivariate distribution estimation and private estimation over complex data) under LDP. Furthermore, we present current research circumstances on LDP including the private statistical learning/inferencing, private statistical data analysis, privacy amplification techniques for LDP, and some application fields under LDP. Finally, we identify future research directions and open challenges for LDP. This survey can serve as a good reference source for the research of LDP to deal with various privacy-related scenarios to be encountered in practice.}

We use workflow-based design of machine learning pipelines, experimentation-based teaching, and hands-on approach that focuses on concepts rather than underlying mathematics. We here detail the data analysis workflows we use in training and motivate them from the viewpoint of teaching goals. Our proposed approach relies on Orange, an open-source data science toolbox that combines data visualization and machine learning, and that is tailored for education in machine learning and explorative data analysis.},

  abstract = {In most situations, simple techniques for handling missing data (such as complete case analysis, overall mean imputation, and the missing-indicator method) produce biased results, whereas imputation techniques yield valid results without complicating the analysis once the imputations are carried out. Imputation techniques are based on the idea that any subject in a study sample can be replaced by a new randomly chosen subject from the same source population. Imputation of missing data on a variable is replacing that missing by a value that is drawn from an estimate of the distribution of this variable. In single imputation, only one estimate is used. In multiple imputation, various estimates are used, reflecting the uncertainty in the estimation of this distribution. Under the general conditions of so-called missing at random and missing completely at random, both single and multiple imputations result in unbiased estimates of study associations. But single imputation results in too small estimated standard errors, whereas multiple imputation results in correctly estimated standard errors and confidence intervals. In this article we explain why all this is the case, and use a simple simulation study to demonstrate our explanations. We also explain and illustrate why two frequently used methods to handle missing data, i.e., overall mean imputation and the missing-indicator method, almost always result in biased estimates.},

Each of these existing notions has problems in some specific scenarios. In this paper we illustrate the limitations of existing notions by constructing such scenarios, and introduce a formal definition on location privacy by quantifying the distance between the prior and posterior distribution over the possible locations. Further more, we show how to construct a near-optimal obfuscation mechanism by solving an optimization problem. We compare our proposed mechanism with the Laplace noise based geo-indistinguishable mechanism, and Shokri's optimal obfuscation mechanism, using both our proposed privacy metric and the traditional metric based on the estimated distance errors. The results show that our proposed metric better describes location privacy and our proposed mechanism makes a better tradeoff between privacy and utility.},

This has triggered the commencement of a new computing model called cloud computing, in which IT-Resources are catered as general utilities that can be hired and released by users through the Internet in an on-demand fashion. According to Gartner Survey Report, The marketplace for public-cloud is predicted to reach from `\$260 billion' in 2017 to around `\$411 billion in 2020'. As more and more IT systems are externalized, it is getting more imminent for us to choose the right cloud service provider for long term success. However, the challenge is to choose the best cloud service provider from the vast number of options like AWS, Azure and GCP to the smaller CSP's. As per Market share the Top 3 Global leaders are AWS, Azure and GCP1. In this paper, we will try to make analysis of between the three market leaders in cloud services namely Amazon, Microsoft \& Google. We will also compare and contrast what AWS, Azure, and GCP offer in terms of storage, compute, management tools etc.},

We first summarize the results of a Systematic Literature Review that we performed to discover what researchers have written about DevOps. We then describe the results of an exploratory interview-based study involving six organizations of various sizes that are active in various industries. As part of our findings, we observed that all organizations were positive about their experiences and only minor problems were encountered while adopting DevOps.}

  abstract = {Clustering algorithms have emerged as an alternative powerful meta-learning tool to accurately analyze the massive volume of data generated by modern applications. In particular, their main goal is to categorize data into clusters such that objects are grouped in the same cluster when they are similar according to specific metrics. There is a vast body of knowledge in the area of clustering and there has been attempts to analyze and categorize them for a larger number of applications. However, one of the major issues in using clustering algorithms for big data that causes confusion amongst practitioners is the lack of consensus in the definition of their properties as well as a lack of formal categorization. With the intention of alleviating these problems, this paper introduces concepts and algorithms related to clustering, a concise survey of existing (clustering) algorithms as well as providing a comparison, both from a theoretical and an empirical perspective. From a theoretical perspective, we developed a categorizing framework based on the main properties pointed out in previous studies. Empirically, we conducted extensive experiments where we compared the most representative algorithm from each of the categories using a large number of real (big) data sets. The effectiveness of the candidate clustering algorithms is measured through a number of internal and external validity metrics, stability, runtime, and scalability tests. In addition, we highlighted the set of clustering algorithms that are the best performing for big data.},

In this paper we combine ideas from "generalised differential privacy" and machine learning techniques for text processing to model privacy for text documents. We define a privacy mechanism that operates at the level of text documents represented as "bags-of-words" - these representations are typical in machine learning and contain sufficient information to carry out many kinds of classification tasks including topic identification and authorship attribution (of the original documents). We show that our mechanism satisfies privacy with respect to a metric for semantic similarity, thereby providing a balance between utility, defined by the semantic content of texts, with the obfuscation of stylistic clues. We demonstrate our implementation on a "fan fiction" dataset, confirming that it is indeed possible to disguise writing style effectively whilst preserving enough information and variation for accurate content classification tasks.},

Such ``exemplars'' can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called ``affinity propagation,'' which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},

Differential privacy requires that computations be insensitive to changes in any particular individual's record, thereby restricting data leaks through the results. The privacy preserving interface ensures unconditionally safe access to the data and does not require from the data miner any expertise in privacy. However, as we show in the paper, a naive utilization of the interface to construct privacy preserving data mining algorithms could lead to inferior data mining results. We address this problem by considering the privacy and the algorithmic requirements simultaneously, focusing on decision tree induction as a sample application. The privacy mechanism has a profound effect on the performance of the methods chosen by the data miner. We demonstrate that this choice could make the difference between an accurate classifier and a completely useless one. Moreover, an improved algorithm can achieve the same level of accuracy and privacy as the naive implementation but with an order of magnitude fewer learning samples.},

  abstract = {Clustering is a central approach for unsupervised learning. After clustering is applied, the most fundamental analysis is to quantitatively compare clusterings. Such comparisons are crucial for the evaluation of clustering methods as well as other tasks such as consensus clustering. It is often argued that, in order to establish a baseline, clustering similarity should be assessed in the context of a random ensemble of clusterings. The prevailing assumption for the random clustering ensemble is the permutation model in which the number and sizes of clusters are fixed. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold in practice; for example, multiple runs of K-means clustering returns clusterings with a fixed number of clusters, while the cluster size distribution varies greatly. Here, we derive corrected variants of two clustering similarity measures (the Rand index and Mutual Information) in the context of two random clustering ensembles in which the number and sizes of clusters vary. In addition, we study the impact of one-sided comparisons in the scenario with a reference clustering. The consequences of different random models are illustrated using synthetic examples, handwriting recognition, and gene expression data. We demonstrate that the choice of random model can have a drastic impact on the ranking of similar clustering pairs, and the evaluation of a clustering method with respect to a random baseline; thus, the choice of random clustering model should be carefully justified.},

The class of noise probability distributions in the optimal mechanism has \{\textbackslash em staircase-shaped\} probability density functions which are symmetric (around the origin), monotonically decreasing and geometrically decaying. The staircase mechanism can be viewed as a \{\textbackslash em geometric mixture of uniform probability distributions\}, providing a simple algorithmic description for the mechanism. Furthermore, the staircase mechanism naturally generalizes to discrete query output settings as well as more abstract settings. We explicitly derive the optimal noise probability distributions with minimum expectation of noise amplitude and power. Comparing the optimal performances with those of the Laplacian mechanism, we show that in the high privacy regime (\$\textbackslash epsilon\$ is small), Laplacian mechanism is asymptotically optimal as \$\textbackslash epsilon \textbackslash to 0\$; in the low privacy regime (\$\textbackslash epsilon\$ is large), the minimum expectation of noise amplitude and minimum noise power are \$\textbackslash Theta(\textbackslash Delta e\^\{-\textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash epsilon\}\{2\}\})\$ and \$\textbackslash Theta(\textbackslash Delta\^2 e\^\{-\textbackslash frac\{2\textbackslash epsilon\}\{3\}\})\$ as \$\textbackslash epsilon \textbackslash to +\textbackslash infty\$, while the expectation of noise amplitude and power using the Laplacian mechanism are \$\textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash Delta\}\{\textbackslash epsilon\}\$ and \$\textbackslash frac\{2\textbackslash Delta\^2\}\{\textbackslash epsilon\^2\}\$, where \$\textbackslash Delta\$ is the sensitivity of the query function.

It essentially consists of randomizing strongly both attribute and cut-point choice while splitting a tree node. In the extreme case, it builds totally randomized trees whose structures are independent of the output values of the learning sample. The strength of the randomization can be tuned to problem specifics by the appropriate choice of a parameter. We evaluate the robustness of the default choice of this parameter, and we also provide insight on how to adjust it in particular situations. Besides accuracy, the main strength of the resulting algorithm is computational efficiency. A bias/variance analysis of the Extra-Trees algorithm is also provided as well as a geometrical and a kernel characterization of the models induced.}

  abstract = {This paper presents a learning theory pertinent to dynamic decision making (DDM) called instancebased learning theory (IBLT). IBLT proposes five learning mechanisms in the context of a decision-making process: instance-based knowledge, recognition-based retrieval, adaptive strategies, necessity-based choice, and feedback updates. IBLT suggests in DDM people learn with the accumulation and refinement of instances, containing the decision-making situation, action, and utility of decisions. As decision makers interact with a dynamic task, they recognize a situation according to its similarity to past instances, adapt their judgment strategies from heuristic-based to instance-based, and refine the accumulated knowledge according to feedback on the result of their actions. The IBLT's learning mechanisms have been implemented in an ACT-R cognitive model. Through a series of experiments, this paper shows how the IBLT's learning mechanisms closely approximate the relative trend magnitude and performance of human data. Although the cognitive model is bounded within the context of a dynamic task, the IBLT is a general theory of decision making applicable to other dynamic environments.},

The well-known phenomenon of the ``curse of dimensionality'' states: many problems become exponentially difficult in high dimensions. Recently, the other side of the coin, the ``blessing of dimensionality'', has attracted much attention. It turns out that generic high-dimensional datasets exhibit fairly simple geometric properties. Thus, there is a fundamental tradeoff between complexity and simplicity in high dimensional spaces. Here we present a brief explanatory review of recent ideas, results and hypotheses about the blessing of dimensionality and related simplifying effects relevant to machine learning and neuroscience.},

  abstract = {Modern cyber physical systems (CPSs) has widely being used in our daily lives because of development of information and communication technologies (ICT).With the provision of CPSs, the security and privacy threats associated to these systems are also increasing. Passive attacks are being used by intruders to get access to private information of CPSs. In order to make CPSs data more secure, certain privacy preservation strategies such as encryption, and k-anonymity have been presented in the past. However, with the advances in CPSs architecture, these techniques also needs certain modifications. Meanwhile, differential privacy emerged as an efficient technique to protect CPSs data privacy. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of differential privacy techniques for CPSs. In particular, we survey the application and implementation of differential privacy in four major applications of CPSs named as energy systems, transportation systems, healthcare and medical systems, and industrial Internet of things (IIoT). Furthermore, we present open issues, challenges, and future research direction for differential privacy techniques for CPSs. This survey can serve as basis for the development of modern differential privacy techniques to address various problems and data privacy scenarios of CPSs.},

  abstract = {Measuring the quality of a clustering algorithm has shown to be as important as the algorithm itself. It is a crucial part of choosing the clustering algorithm that performs best for an input data. Streaming input data have many features that make them much more challenging than static ones. They are endless, varying and emerging with high speeds. This raised new challenges for the clustering algorithms as well as for their evaluation measures. Up till now, external evaluation measures were exclusively used for validating stream clustering algorithms. While external validation requires a ground truth which is not provided in most applications, particularly in the streaming case, internal clustering validation is efficient and realistic. In this article, we analyze the properties and performances of eleven internal clustering measures. In particular, we apply these measures to carefully synthesized stream scenarios to reveal how they react to clusterings on evolving data streams using both k-means-based and density-based clustering algorithms. A series of experimental results show that different from the case with static data, the Calinski-Harabasz index performs the best in coping with common aspects and errors of stream clustering for k-means-based algorithms, while the revised validity index performs the best for density-based ones.}

Selecting features in unsupervised learning scenarios is a much harder problem, due to the absence of class labels that would guide the search for relevant information. And, almost all of previous unsupervised feature selection methods are "wrapper" techniques that require a learning algorithm to evaluate the candidate feature subsets. In this paper, we propose a "filter" method for feature selection which is independent of any learning algorithm. Our method can be performed in either supervised or unsupervised fashion. The proposed method is based on the observation that, in many real world classification problems, data from the same class are often close to each other. The importance of a feature is evaluated by its power of locality preserving, or, Laplacian Score. We compare our method with data variance (unsupervised) and Fisher score (supervised) on two data sets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.},

In this paper, we investigate how the privacy goal that the inclusion of one's location history in a statistical database with location pattern mining capabilities does not substantially increase one's privacy risk. In particular, we propose a differentially private pattern mining algorithm for interesting geographic location discovery using a region quadtree spatial decomposition to preprocess the location points followed by applying a density-based clustering algorithm. A differentially private region quadtree is used for both de-noising the spatial domain and identifying the likely geographic regions containing the interesting locations. Then, a differential privacy mechanism is applied to the algorithm outputs, namely: the interesting regions and their corresponding stay point counts. The quadtree spatial decomposition enables one to obtain a localized reduced sensitivity to achieve the differential privacy goal and accurate outputs. Experimental results on synthetic datasets are used to show the feasibility of the proposed privacy preserving location pattern mining algorithm.},

  abstract = {Evaluation metric plays a critical role in achieving the optimal classifier during the classification training. Thus, a selection of suitable evaluation metric is an important key for discriminating and obtaining the optimal classifier. This paper systematically reviewed the related evaluation metrics that are specifically designed as a discriminator for optimizing generative classifier. Generally, many generative classifiers employ accuracy as a measure to discriminate the optimal solution during the classification training. However, the accuracy has several weaknesses which are less distinctiveness, less discriminability, less informativeness and bias to majority class data. This paper also briefly discusses other metrics that are specifically designed for discriminating the optimal solution. The shortcomings of these alternative metrics are also discussed. Finally, this paper suggests five important aspects that must be taken into consideration in constructing a new discriminator metric.},

To address challenges that arise on the borderline between development and operations, we conducted a study in collaboration with a Swedish company responsible for ticket management and sales in public transportation. The aim of our study was to explore and describe the existing DevOps environment, as well as to identify how the feedback from operations can be improved, specifically with respect to the alerts sent from system operations. Our study complies with the basic principles of the design science paradigm, such as understanding and improving design solutions in the specific areas of practice. Our diagnosis, based on qualitative data collected through interviews and observations, shows that alert flooding is a challenge in the feedback loop, i.e. too much signals from operations create noise in the feedback loop. Therefore, we design a solution to improve the alert management by optimizing when to raise alerts and accordingly introducing a new element in the feedback loop, a smart filter. Moreover, we implemented a prototype of the proposed solution design and showed that a tighter relation between operations and development can be achieved, using a hybrid method which combines rule-based and unsupervised machine learning for operations data analysis.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) models have been widely applied to various applications, including image classification, text generation, audio recognition, and graph data analysis. However, recent studies have shown that ML models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether a data record was used to train a target model or not. MIAs on ML models can directly lead to a privacy breach. For example, via identifying the fact that a clinical record that has been used to train a model associated with a certain disease, an attacker can infer that the owner of the clinical record has the disease with a high chance. In recent years, MIAs have been shown to be effective on various ML models, e.g., classification models and generative models. Meanwhile, many defense methods have been proposed to mitigate MIAs. Although MIAs on ML models form a newly emerging and rapidly growing research area, there has been no systematic survey on this topic yet. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive survey on membership inference attacks and defenses. We provide the taxonomies for both attacks and defenses, based on their characterizations, and discuss their pros and cons. Based on the limitations and gaps identified in this survey, we point out several promising future research directions to inspire the researchers who wish to follow this area. This survey not only serves as a reference for the research community but also provides a clear description for researchers outside this research domain. To further help the researchers, we have created an online resource repository, which we will keep updated with future relevant work.

We begin by reviewing a well-known measure of partition correspondence often attributed to Rand (1971), discuss the issue of correcting this index for chance, and note that a recent normalization strategy developed by Morey and Agresti (1984) and adopted by others (e.g., Miligan and Cooper 1985) is based on an incorrect assumption. Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from corresponding partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addition to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between {$\pm$}1.},

In this paper we performed various methods in avoiding over-fitting and under-fitting; that is penalty and early stopping methods. A comparative study has been presented for the aforementioned methods to evaluate their performance within a range of specific parameters such as; speed of training, over-fitting and under-fitting avoidance, difficulty, capacity, time of training, and their accuracy. Besides these parameters we have included comparison between over-fitting and under-fitting. We found the early stopping method as being better as compared to the penalty method, as it can avoid overfitting and under-fitting with respect to validation time. Besides we find that Under-fitting neural networks perform poorly on both training and test sets, but Over-fitting networks may do very well on training sets though terribly on test sets.},

  abstract = {Differential privacy is a strong notion for privacy that can be used to prove formal guarantees, in terms of a privacy budget, , about how much information is leaked by a mechanism. When used in privacy-preserving machine learning, the goal is typically to limit what can be inferred from the model about individual training records. However, the calibration of the privacy budget is not well understood. Implementations of privacy-preserving machine learning often select large values of in order to get acceptable utility of the model, with little understanding of the impact of such choices on meaningful privacy. Moreover, in scenarios where iterative learning procedures are used, relaxed definitions of differential privacy are often used which appear to reduce the needed privacy budget but present poorly understood trade-offs between privacy and utility. In this paper, we quantify the impact of these choices on privacy in experiments with logistic regression and neural network models. Our main finding is that there is no way to obtain privacy for free\textemdash relaxed definitions of differential privacy that reduce the amount of noise needed to improve utility also increase the measured privacy leakage. Current mechanisms for differentially private machine learning rarely offer acceptable utility-privacy trade-offs for complex learning tasks: settings that provide limited accuracy loss provide little effective privacy, and settings that provide strong privacy result in useless models.},

  abstract = {Leakage of data from publicly available Machine Learning (ML) models is an area of growing significance as commercial and government applications of ML can draw on multiple sources of data, potentially including users' and clients' sensitive data. We provide a comprehensive survey of contemporary advances on several fronts, covering involuntary data leakage which is natural to ML models, potential malevolent leakage which is caused by privacy attacks, and currently available defence mechanisms. We focus on inference-time leakage, as the most likely scenario for publicly available models. We first discuss what leakage is in the context of different data, tasks, and model architectures. We then propose a taxonomy across involuntary and malevolent leakage, available defences, followed by the currently available assessment metrics and applications. We conclude with outstanding challenges and open questions, outlining some promising directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Background: Research in biomedical text categorization has mostly used the bag-of-words representation. Other more sophisticated representations of text based on syntactic, semantic and argumentative properties have been less studied. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of different text representations of biomedical texts as features for reproducing the MeSH annotations of some of the most frequent MeSH headings. In addition to unigrams and bigrams, these features include noun phrases, citation meta-data, citation structure, and semantic annotation of the citations. Results: Traditional features like unigrams and bigrams exhibit strong performance compared to other feature sets. Little or no improvement is obtained when using meta-data or citation structure. Noun phrases are too sparse and thus have lower performance compared to more traditional features. Conceptual annotation of the texts by MetaMap shows similar performance compared to unigrams, but adding concepts from the UMLS taxonomy does not improve the performance of using only mapped concepts. The combination of all the features performs largely better than any individual feature set considered. In addition, this combination improves the performance of a state-of-the-art MeSH indexer. Concerning the machine learning algorithms, we find that those that are more resilient to class imbalance largely obtain better performance. Conclusions: We conclude that even though traditional features such as unigrams and bigrams have strong performance compared to other features, it is possible to combine them to effectively improve the performance of the bag-of-words representation. We have also found that the combination of the learning algorithm and feature sets has an influence in the overall performance of the system. Moreover, using learning algorithms resilient to class imbalance largely improves performance. However, when using a large set of features, consideration needs to be taken with algorithms due to the risk of over-fitting. Specific combinations of learning algorithms and features for individual MeSH headings could further increase the performance of an indexing system.},

In a regression (or in a non parametric regression) setting, criteria such as the general cross-validation one (GCV) provide convenient approximations to leave-one-out cross-validation. They are based on the relation between the prediction error and the residual sum of squares weighted by elements of a projection matrix (or a smoothing matrix). Such a relation is then established in PCA using an original presentation of PCA with a unique projection matrix. It enables the definition of two cross-validation approximation criteria: the smoothing approximation of the cross-validation criterion (SACV) and the GCV criterion. The method is assessed with simulations and gives promising results.},

  abstract = {One of the more recent avenues towards more flexible installations and execution is the transition from monolithic architecture to microservice architecture. In such architecture, where microservices can be more liberally updated, relocated, and replaced, building liquid software also becomes simpler, as adaptation and deployment of code is easier than when using a monolithic architecture where almost everything is connected. In this paper, we study this type of transition. The objective is to identify the reasons why the companies decide to make such transition, and identify the challenges that companies may face during this transition. Our method is a survey based on di{$\carriagereturn$}erent publications and case studies conducted about these architectural transitions from monolithic architecture to microservices. Our findings reveal that typical reasons moving towards microservice architecture are complexity, scalability and code ownership. The challenges, on the other hand, can be separated to architectural challenges and organizational challenges. The conclusion is that when a software company grows big enough in size and starts facing problems regarding the size of the codebase, that is when microservices can be a good way to handle the complexity and size. Even though the transition provides its own challenges, these challenges can be easier to solve than the challenges that monolithic architecture presents to company.},

However, despite all advantages cited for artificial neural networks, their performance for some real time series is not satisfactory. Improving forecasting especially time series forecasting accuracy is an important yet often difficult task facing forecasters. Both theoretical and empirical findings have indicated that integration of different models can be an effective way of improving upon their predictive performance, especially when the models in the ensemble are quite different. In this paper, a novel hybrid model of artificial neural networks is proposed using auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models in order to yield a more accurate forecasting model than artificial neural networks. The empirical results with three well-known real data sets indicate that the proposed model can be an effective way to improve forecasting accuracy achieved by artificial neural networks. Therefore, it can be used as an appropriate alternative model for forecasting task, especially when higher forecasting accuracy is needed.}

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is defined as a group of metabolic disorders exerting significant pressure on human health worldwide. Extensive research in all aspects of diabetes (diagnosis, etiopathophysiology, therapy, etc.) has led to the generation of huge amounts of data. The aim of the present study is to conduct a systematic review of the applications of machine learning, data mining techniques and tools in the field of diabetes research with respect to a) Prediction and Diagnosis, b) Diabetic Complications, c) Genetic Background and Environment, and e) Health Care and Management with the first category appearing to be the most popular. A wide range of machine learning algorithms were employed. In general, 85\% of those used were characterized by supervised learning approaches and 15\% by unsupervised ones, and more specifically, association rules. Support vector machines (SVM) arise as the most successful and widely used algorithm. Concerning the type of data, clinical datasets were mainly used. The title applications in the selected articles project the usefulness of extracting valuable knowledge leading to new hypotheses targeting deeper understanding and further investigation in DM.},

Dictionaries contain a collection of objects, or records, which in turn have many different fields within them, each containing data. These records are stored and retrieved using a key that uniquely identifies the record, and is used to quickly find the data within the database.  Key-value databases work in a very different fashion from the better known relational databases (RDB). RDBs pre-define the data structure in the database as a series of tables containing fields with well defined data types. Exposing the data types to the database program allows it to apply a number of optimizations. In contrast, key-value systems treat the data as a single opaque collection, which may have different fields for every record. This offers considerable flexibility and more closely follows modern concepts like object-oriented programming. Because optional values are not represented by placeholders or input parameters, as in most RDBs, key-value databases often use far less memory to store the same database, which can lead to large performance gains in certain workloads.Performance, a lack of standardization and other issues limited key-value systems to niche uses for many years, but the rapid move to cloud computing after 2010 has led to a renaissance as part of the broader NoSQL movement. Some graph databases are also key-value databases internally, adding the concept of the relationships (pointers) between records as a first class data type.},

  abstract = {The latest edition of the single most authoritative guide on dimensional modeling for data warehousing! Dimensional modeling has become the most widely accepted approach for data warehouse design. Here is a complete library of dimensional modeling techniques-- the most comprehensive collection ever written. Greatly expanded to cover both basic and advanced techniques for optimizing data warehouse design, this second edition to Ralph Kimball's classic guide is more than sixty percent updated. The authors begin with fundamental design recommendations and gradually progress step-by-step through increasingly complex scenarios. Clear-cut guidelines for designing dimensional models are illustrated using real-world data warehouse case studies drawn from a variety of business application areas and industries, including: * Retail sales and e-commerce * Inventory management * Procurement * Order management * Customer relationship management (CRM) * Human resources management * Accounting * Financial services * Telecommunications and utilities * Education * Transportation * Health care and insurance By the end of the book, you will have mastered the full range of powerful techniques for designing dimensional databases that are easy to understand and provide fast query response. You will also learn how to create an architected framework that integrates the distributed data warehouse using standardized dimensions and facts. This book is also available as part of the Kimball's Data Warehouse Toolkit Classics Box Set (ISBN: 9780470479575) with the following 3 books: The Data Warehouse Toolkit, 2nd Edition (9780471200246) The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit, 2nd Edition (9780470149775) The Data Warehouse ETL Toolkit (9780764567575)},

On the basis of this relation, a new method is proposed for determining the ARMA model parameters from the coefficients of a finite-order EMA model. This method is a three-step approach: in the first step, a simple recursion relating the EMA model parameters and the cepstral coefficients of an ARMA process is derived to estimate the EMA model parameters; in the second step, the AR parameters are estimated by solving the linear equation set composed of EMA parameters; then, the MA parameters are obtained via simple computations using the estimated EMA and AR parameters. Simulations including both low- and high-order ARMA processes are given to demonstrate the performance of the new method. The end results are compared with the existing method in the literature over some performance criteria. It is observed from the simulations that our new algorithm produces the satisfactory and acceptable results.},

To achieve the best possible performance with a particular learning algorithm on a particular training set, a feature subset selection method should consider how the algorithm and the training set interact. We explore the relation between optimal feature subset selection and relevance. Our wrapper method searches for an optimal feature subset tailored to a particular algorithm and a domain. We study the strengths and weaknesses of the wrapper approach and show a series of improved designs. We compare the wrapper approach to induction without feature subset selection and to Relief, a filter approach to feature subset selection. Significant improvement in accuracy is achieved for some datasets for the two families of induction algorithms used: decision trees and Naive-Bayes.},

For crossvalidation, we vary the number of folds and whether the folds are strati ed or not for bootstrap, we vary the number of bootstrap samples.

Data pre-processing includes data cleaning, normalization, transformation, feature extraction and selection, etc. The product of data pre-processing is the final training set. It would be nice if a single sequence of data pre-processing algorithms had the best performance for each data set but this is not happened. Thus, we present the most well know algorithms for each step of data pre-processing so that one achieves the best performance for their data set.},

Data heterogeneity in FL makes the data non-IID (Non-Independent and Identically Distributed). We use a novel approach to create non-IID partitions of data by solving an optimization problem. In this work, each device trains a decision tree classifier. Devices share the root node of their trees with the aggregator. The aggregator merges the trees by choosing the most common split attribute and grows the branches based on the split values of the chosen split attribute. This recursive process stops when all the nodes to be merged are leaf nodes. After the merging operation, the aggregator sends the merged decision tree to the distributed devices. Therefore, we aim to build a joint machine learning model based on the data from multiple devices while offering k-anonymity to the participants.},

When applying these techniques, it is important to determine how many factors to retain. This decision is sometimes based on a visual inspection of the Scree plot. However, the Scree plot may at times be ambiguous and open to interpretation. This paper aims to explore a number of graphical and computational improvements to the Scree plot in order to make it more valid and informative. These enhancements are based on dynamic and interactive data visualization tools, and range from adding Parallel Analysis results to "linking" the Scree plot with other graphics, such as factor-loadings plots. To illustrate our proposed improvements, we introduce and describe an example based on real data on which a principal component analysis is appropriate. We hope to provide better graphical tools to help researchers determine the number of factors to retain.}

Assuming the positive (minority) class is the group of interest and the given application domain dictates that a false negative is much costlier than a false positive, a negative (majority) class prediction bias could have adverse consequences. With big data, the mitigation of class imbalance poses an even greater challenge because of the varied and complex structure of the relatively much larger datasets. This paper provides a large survey of published studies within the last 8~years, focusing on high-class imbalance (i.e., a majority-to-minority class ratio between 100:1 and 10,000:1) in big data in order to assess the state-of-the-art in addressing adverse effects due to class imbalance. In this paper, two techniques are covered which include Data-Level (e.g., data sampling) and Algorithm-Level (e.g., cost-sensitive and hybrid/ensemble) Methods. Data sampling methods are popular in addressing class imbalance, with Random Over-Sampling methods generally showing better overall results. At the Algorithm-Level, there are some outstanding performers. Yet, in the published studies, there are inconsistent and conflicting results, coupled with a limited scope in evaluated techniques, indicating the need for more comprehensive, comparative studies.}

  abstract = {The Lambert W function is a mathematical function with a long history, but which was named and rigorously defined relatively recently. It is closely related to the logarithmic function and arises from many models in the natural sciences, including a surprising number of problems in ecology and evolution. I describe the basic properties of the function and present examples of its application to models of ecological and evolutionary processes. The Lambert W function makes it possible to solve explicitly several models where this is not possible with elementary functions. I present examples of such models from existing literature, as well as novel models. Solving models explicitly with the Lambert W function can provide deeper insight and a new point of view on a biological problem. Explicit solutions with the Lambert W function are easily amenable to further mathematical operations, such as differentiation and integration. These advantages apply to a wide range of models, from the marginal value theorem to population growth rates and disease epidemics.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has been widely adopted in various privacy-critical applications, e.g., face recognition and medical image analysis. However, recent research has shown that ML models are vulnerable to attacks against their training data. Membership inference is one major attack in this domain: Given a data sample and model, an adversary aims to determine whether the sample is part of the model's training set. Existing membership inference attacks leverage the confidence scores returned by the model as their inputs (score-based attacks). However, these attacks can be easily mitigated if the model only exposes the predicted label, i.e., the final model decision. In this paper, we propose decision-based membership inference attacks and demonstrate that label-only exposures are also vulnerable to membership leakage. In particular, we develop two types of decision-based attacks, namely transfer attack, and boundary attack. Empirical evaluation shows that our decision-based attacks can achieve remarkable performance, and even outperform the previous score-based attacks in some cases. We further present new insights on the success of membership inference based on quantitative and qualitative analysis, i.e., member samples of a model are more distant to the model's decision boundary than non-member samples. Finally, we evaluate multiple defense mechanisms against our decision-based attacks and show that our two types of attacks can bypass most of these defenses.},

However, the reality is almost always the opposite case. Hence, IT engineers dream of a reliable and usable DevOps environment that can substantially facilitate their developments and simplify their operations. Current DevOps environments include Google App Engine, Docker, Kubernetes, Mesos, and so forth. In other words, PaaS bridges the gap between vivid IT engineers and stiff cloud systems. In this paper, we comprehensively examine state-of-the-art PaaS solutions across various tiers of the cloud-computing DevOps stack. On this basis, we identify areas of consensus and diversity in their philosophies and methodologies. In addition, we explore cutting-edge solutions towards realizing a more fine-grained, full-stack DevOps environment. From this paper, readers are expected to quickly grasp the essence, current status, and future prospects of PaaS.},

A modification of the method to train the multi-vector for each polysemous word is also presented where each vector represents a different meaning of its word. These multiple vectors can accommodate several different meanings of their word.

However, there are few papers studying the DBSCAN algorithm under the privacy preserving distributed data mining model, in which the data is distributed between two or more parties, and the parties cooperate to obtain the clustering results without revealing the data at the individual parties. In this paper, we address the problem of two-party privacy preserving DBSCAN clustering. We first propose two protocols for privacy preserving DBSCAN clustering over horizontally and vertically partitioned data respectively and then extend them to arbitrarily partitioned data. We also provide analysis of the performance and proof of privacy of our solution.},

  abstract = {The newly emerged machine learning (e.g., deep learning) methods have become a strong driving force to revolutionize a wide range of industries, such as smart healthcare, financial technology, and surveillance systems. Meanwhile, privacy has emerged as a big concern in this machine learning-based artificial intelligence era. It is important to note that the problem of privacy preservation in the context of machine learning is quite different from that in traditional data privacy protection, as machine learning can act as both friend and foe. Currently, the work on the preservation of privacy and machine learning are still in an infancy stage, as most existing solutions only focus on privacy problems during the machine learning process. Therefore, a comprehensive study on the privacy preservation problems and machine learning is required. This article surveys the state of the art in privacy issues and solutions for machine learning. The survey covers three categories of interactions between privacy and machine learning: (i) private machine learning, (ii) machine learning-aided privacy protection, and (iii) machine learning-based privacy attack and corresponding protection schemes. The current research progress in each category is reviewed and the key challenges are identified. Finally, based on our in-depth analysis of the area of privacy and machine learning, we point out future research directions in this field.},

This paper proposes a fundamentally different model-based method that explicitly isolates anomalies instead of profiles normal points. To our best knowledge, the concept of isolation has not been explored in current literature. The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and Random Forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies.},

Businesses are required to be agile and flexible and IT managers are being asked to deliver improved functionality while leveraging existing IT investment. In this climate, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is proving to be an attractive approach to Enterprise Application Integration and other solutions that they seek. SOA promises better alignment of IT with business, effective reuse, interoperability and reduced costs of development. However, like any approach, it has its limitations and therefore posses a number of challenges. In this paper, we introduce the SOA approach, present the benefits it offers and discuss the inherent issues and challenges. The objective is to provide enough background information that enterprises wishing to embark on the road to SOA have a better understanding of this approach.},

A Blob interface, which represents immutable raw binary data, and allows access to ranges of bytes within the Blob object as a separate Blob. A File interface, which includes readonly informational attributes about a file such as its name and the date of the last modification (on disk) of the file. A FileReader interface, which provides methods to read a File or a Blob, and an event model to obtain the results of these reads. A URL scheme for use with binary data such as files, so that they can be referenced within web applications. Additionally, this specification defines objects to be used within threaded web applications for the synchronous reading of files. \textsection 10 Requirements and Use Cases covers the motivation behind this specification. This API is designed to be used in conjunction with other APIs and elements on the web platform, notably: XMLHttpRequest (e.g. with an overloaded send() method for File or Blob arguments), postMessage(), DataTransfer (part of the drag and drop API defined in [HTML]) and Web Workers. Additionally, it should be possible to programmatically obtain a list of files from the input element when it is in the File Upload state  [HTML].

As shape masks carry information about the extent (outline) of objects, they provide a convenient tool to exploit the geometry of objects. We apply our ideas to two common object class recognition tasks-classification and localization. For classification, we extend the orderless bag-of-features image representation. In the proposed setup shape masks can be seen as weak geometrical constraints over bag-of-features. Those constraints can be used to reduce background clutter and help recognition. For localization, we propose a new recognition scheme based on high-dimensional hypothesis clustering. Shape masks allow to go beyond bounding boxes and determine the outline (approximate segmentation) of the object during localization. Furthermore, the method easily learns and detects possible object viewpoints and articulations, which are often well characterized by the object outline. Our experiments reveal that shape masks can improve recognition accuracy of state-of-the-art methods while returning richer recognition answers at the same time. We evaluate the proposed approach on the challenging natural-scene Graz-02 object classes dataset.},

However, most of these systems are built around an acyclic data flow model that is not suitable for other popular applications. This paper focuses on one such class of applications: those that reuse a working set of data across multiple parallel operations. This includes many iterative machine learning algorithms, as well as interactive data analysis tools. We propose a new framework called Spark that supports these applications while retaining the scalability and fault tolerance of MapReduce. To achieve these goals, Spark introduces an abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). An RDD is a read-only collection of objects partitioned across a set of machines that can be rebuilt if a partition is lost. Spark can outperform Hadoop by 10x in iterative machine learning jobs, and can be used to interactively query a 39 GB dataset with sub-second response time.},

In high-level visions of open data, researchers' data and metadata practices are expected to be robust and structured. The integration of the internet into scientific institutions amplifies these expectations. When examined critically, however, the data and metadata practices of scholarly researchers often appear incomplete or deficient. The concepts of ``accountability'' and ``transparency'' provide insight in understanding these perceived gaps. Researchers' primary accountabilities are related to meeting the expectations of research competency, not to external standards of data deposition or metadata creation. Likewise, making data open in a transparent way can involve a significant investment of time and resources with no obvious benefits. This paper uses differing notions of accountability and transparency to conceptualize ``open data'' as the result of ongoing achievements, not one-time acts.},

In this work, we target privacy-preserving collaborative hierarchical clustering. We introduce a formal security definition that aims to achieve the balance between utility and privacy and present a two-party protocol that provably satisfies it. We then extend our protocol with: (i) an optimized version for the single-linkage clustering, and (ii) scalable approximation variants. We implement all our schemes and experimentally evaluate their performance and accuracy on synthetic and real datasets, obtaining very encouraging results. For example, end-to-end execution of our secure approximate protocol for over 1M 10-dimensional data samples requires 35sec of computation and achieves 97.09\% accuracy.},

Thus, before large-scale quantum computers are built, we need to migrate our systems and practices to ones that cannot be broken by quantum computers. For systems that aim to provide long-term confidentiality, this migration should happen even sooner. There are viable options for quantum-proofing our cryptographic infrastructure, but the road ahead is neither easy nor fast. Impressive progress in developing the building blocks of a fault-tolerant scalable quantum computer indicates that the prospect of a large-scale quantum computer is a medium-term threat. For example, I estimate a \$1/2\$ chance of breaking RSA-2048 by \$2031\$.

The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure.

  abstract = {The advent of numerous indoor location-based services (LBSs) and the widespread use of many types of mobile devices in indoor environments have resulted in generating a massive amount of people's location data. While geo-spatial data contains sensitive information about personal activities, collecting it in its raw form may lead to the leak of personal information relating to the people, violating their privacy. This paper proposes a novel privacy-aware framework for aggregating the indoor location data employing the Local Differential Privacy (LDP) technique, in which the user location data is changed locally in the user's device and is sent to the aggregator afterward. Therefore, the users' locations are kept hidden from a server or any attackers. The practical feasibility of applying the proposed framework is verified by two real-world datasets. The impact of dataset properties, the privacy mechanisms, and the privacy level on our framework are also investigated. The experimental results indicate that the presented framework can protect the location information of users, and the accuracy of the population frequency of different zones in the indoor area is close to that of the original population frequency with no knowledge about the location of people indoors.},

  abstract = {Recommendation systems rely heavily on users behavioural and preferential data (e.g. ratings, likes) to produce accurate recommendations. However, users experience privacy concerns due to unethical data aggregation and analytical practices carried out by the Service Providers (SP). Local differential privacy (LDP) based perturbation mechanisms add noise to users data at user side before sending it to the SP. The SP then uses the perturbed data to perform recommendations. Although LDP protects the privacy of users from SP, it causes a substantial decline in predictive accuracy. To address this issue, we propose an LDP-based Matrix Factorization (MF) with a Gaussian Mixture Model (MoG). The LDP perturbation mechanism, Bounded Laplace (BLP), regulates the effect of noise by confining the perturbed ratings to a predetermined domain. We derive a sufficient condition of the scale parameter for BLP to satisfy \$\textbackslash epsilon\$ LDP. At the SP, The MoG model estimates the noise added to perturbed ratings and the MF algorithm predicts missing ratings. Our proposed LDP based recommendation system improves the recommendation accuracy without violating LDP principles. The empirical evaluations carried out on three real world datasets, i.e., Movielens, Libimseti and Jester, demonstrate that our method offers a substantial increase in predictive accuracy under strong privacy guarantee.},

Measurement of abdominal obesity is strongly associated with increased cardiometabolic risk, cardiovascular events, and mortality. Although waist circumference is a crude measurement, it correlates with obesity and visceral fat amount, and is a surrogate marker for insulin resistance. A normal waist circumference differs for specific ethnic groups due to different cardiometabolic risk. For example, Asians have increased cardiometabolic risk at lower body mass indexes and with lower waist circumferences than other populations. One criterion for the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome, according to different study groups, includes measurement of abdominal obesity (waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio) because visceral adipose tissue is a key component of the syndrome. The waist circumference measurement is a simple tool that should be widely implemented in clinical practice to improve cardiometabolic risk stratification.},

Whereas all missing data treatments are imperfect and are rooted in particular statistical assumptions, some missing data treatments are worse than others, on average (i.e., they lead to more bias in parameter estimates and less accurate hypothesis tests). Social scientists still routinely choose the more biased and error-prone techniques (listwise and pairwise deletion), likely due to poor familiarity with and misconceptions about the less biased/less error-prone techniques (maximum likelihood and multiple imputation). The current user-friendly review provides five easy-to-understand practical guidelines, with the goal of reducing missing data bias and error in the reporting of research results.

However, doing so raises privacy concerns, and risks accidental privacy breaches with serious consequences. Local differential privacy (LDP) techniques address this problem by only collecting randomized answers from each user, with guarantees of plausible deniability; meanwhile, the aggregator can still build accurate models and predictors by analyzing large amounts of such randomized data. So far, existing LDP solutions either have severely restricted functionality, or focus mainly on theoretical aspects such as asymptotical bounds rather than practical usability and performance. Motivated by this, we propose Harmony, a practical, accurate and efficient system for collecting and analyzing data from smart device users, while satisfying LDP. Harmony applies to multi-dimensional data containing both numerical and categorical attributes, and supports both basic statistics (e.g., mean and frequency estimates), and complex machine learning tasks (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression and SVM classification). Experiments using real data confirm Harmony's effectiveness.},

Machine Learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are inputs (images, texts, tabular data, etc.) deliberately modified to produce a desired response by the Machine Learning model. ART provides the tools to build and deploy defences and test them with adversarial attacks. Defending Machine Learning models involves certifying and verifying model robustness and model hardening with approaches such as pre-processing inputs, augmenting training data with adversarial samples, and leveraging runtime detection methods to flag any inputs that might have been modified by an adversary. The attacks implemented in ART allow creating adversarial attacks against Machine Learning models which is required to test defenses with state-of-the-art threat models.

The problem is motivated by its various applications to differential privacy, including the sample and aggregate technique, private data exploration, and clustering.   Without privacy concerns, minimum enclosing ball has a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS), which computes a ball of radius almost \$r\_\{opt\}\$ (the problem is NP-hard to solve exactly). In contrast, under differential privacy, until this work, only a \$O(\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash log n\})\$-approximation algorithm was known.   We provide new constructions of differentially private algorithms for minimum enclosing ball achieving constant factor approximation to \$r\_\{opt\}\$ both in the centralized model (where a trusted curator collects the sensitive information and analyzes it with differential privacy) and in the local model (where each respondent randomizes her answers to the data curator to protect her privacy).   We demonstrate how to use our algorithms as a building block for approximating \$k\$-means in both models.},

The goal of private data analysis is to release aggregate information about a data set while protecting the privacy of the individuals whose information the data set contains. Our framework allows one to release functions f of the data with instance-specific additive noise. That is, the noise magnitude is determined not only by the function we want to release, but also by the database itself. One of the challenges is to ensure that the noise magnitude does not leak information about the database. To address that, we calibrate the noise magnitude to the smooth sensitivity of f on the database x \textemdash{} a measure of variability of f in the neighborhood of the instance x. The new framework greatly expands the applicability of output perturbation, a technique for protecting individuals' privacy by adding a small amount of random noise to the released statistics. To our knowledge, this is the first formal analysis of the effect of instance-specific noise in the context of data privacy.},

In addition, it is widely used in determining public health policies.The BMI has been useful in population-based studies by virtue of its wide acceptance in defining specific categories of body mass as a health issue. However, it is increasingly clear that BMI is a rather poor indicator of percent of body fat. Importantly, the BMI also does not capture information on the mass of fat in different body sites. The latter is related not only to untoward health issues but to social issues as well. Lastly, current evidence indicates there is a wide range of BMIs over which mortality risk is modest, and this is age related. All of these issues are discussed in this brief review.},

  abstract = {Ontwikkeling, Test, Acceptatie en Productie, afgekort OTAP  is de naam van een methodiek die wordt gebruikt in de ICT. De hoofdwoorden in de naam geven de fases aan die onder andere in de softwareontwikkeling doorlopen worden. Het Nederlandse begrip is afgeleid van het Engelse DTAP: Development, Testing, Acceptance and Production. Het pad dat wordt doorlopen is als volgt: O: Een programma of component wordt eerst ontwikkeld in de ontwikkelomgeving, hierin bevindt zich veelal een of meerdere personen in een ontwikkelteam die ieder op een ontwikkelwerkplek werken aan 1 gezamenlijke versie, die aan het einde van elke dag wordt gekopieerd ofwel 'ingecheckt' in het versiebeheerprogramma op de ontwikkelserver. T: Deze gezamenlijke versie wordt dan 's nachts automatisch van programmacode naar een draaibaar programma omgezet, ofwel 'gebuild' en eventueel doorgezet naar de testserver. Op de testserver kan er met deeltest, ofwel \textasciiacute unittests\textasciiacute{} automatisch technisch en functioneel getest worden, waarvan de resultaten de volgende dag klaarliggen voor het ontwikkelteam. Als er na een ontwikkelperiode een functionele samengestelde versie ofwel een \textasciiacute release\textasciiacute{} wordt gestabiliseerd, kan deze release volledig doorgetest worden met alle voor de software gekozen testgevallen door alle betrokken partijen, personen en gebruikers. A: Na goedkeuring kan de versie worden ge\"installeerd in de acceptatieomgeving. Het installatieproces wordt gedocumenteerd in een productiegang draaiboek. De acceptatie-omgeving is qua software en hardware zo veel mogelijk gelijk aan de productieomgeving. De klant kan hier alvast zien hoe de release er functioneel en qua performance uit gaat zien in productie. Dit, zonder dat de dagelijkse productie onderbroken wordt. P: Indien de klant accepteert in de acceptatie-omgeving, wordt het programma ge\"installeerd op de productieomgeving, zoals gedocumenteerd toen de release naar de acceptatie-omgeving ging. Tevens moet er een terugdraaiplan zijn om bij verrassingen toch de productie-installatie ongedaan te maken en door te gaan in productie met de oude versie.E: Indien er veel gebruikersopleidingen moeten worden gegeven is het zinvol om een Educatie-omgeving neer te zetten. De educatie-omgeving is ook een productie-omgeving, maar dan voor opleidingen. Hier kan dan ongestoord opleidingen gegeven worden los van het OTAP release proces. Alle andere omgevingen zoals onderhoudsomgevingen en straattestomgevingen zouden goed binnen de OTAP omgevingen gefaciliteerd kunnen worden en daar zijn geen specifieke omgevingen voor benodigd. Met deze OTAP-werkwijze is de software volledig getest en geaccepteerd op een vergelijkbare omgeving als productie. Samen met de voorspelbare gedocumenteerde productiegang en het terugdraaiplan bij verrassingen, is de productie omgeving ultiem beschermd en is de continu\"iteit gewaarborgd.},

A problem with most of these follow-up works is that they blindly rely on geo-indistinguishability to provide location privacy, ignoring the numerical interpretation of this privacy guarantee. In this paper we provide an alternative formulation of geo-indistinguishability as an adversary error, and use it to show that the privacy vs. utility trade-off that can be obtained is not as appealing as implied by the literature. We also show that although geo-indistinguishability guarantees a lower bound on the adversary's error, this comes at the cost of achieving poorer performance than other noise generation mechanisms in terms of average error, and enabling the possibility of exposing obfuscated locations that are useless from the quality of service point of view.},

ML is now pervasive---new systems and models are being deployed in every domain imaginable, leading to rapid and widespread deployment of software based inference and decision making. There is growing recognition that ML exposes new vulnerabilities in software systems, yet the technical community's understanding of the nature and extent of these vulnerabilities remains limited. We systematize recent findings on ML security and privacy, focusing on attacks identified on these systems and defenses crafted to date. We articulate a comprehensive threat model for ML, and categorize attacks and defenses within an adversarial framework. Key insights resulting from works both in the ML and security communities are identified and the effectiveness of approaches are related to structural elements of ML algorithms and the data used to train them. We conclude by formally exploring the opposing relationship between model accuracy and resilience to adversarial manipulation. Through these explorations, we show that there are (possibly unavoidable) tensions between model complexity, accuracy, and resilience that must be calibrated for the environments in which they will be used.},

The heterogeneity in patient data makes it difficult for one particular model to succeed at providing suitable therapy predictions for all patients. An appropriate means for addressing this heterogeneity is through combining kernel and model-based techniques. These methods capture different kinds of information: kernel-based methods are able to identify clusters of similar patients, and work well when modelling the viral response for these groups. In contrast, model-based methods capture the sequential process of decision making, and are able to find simpler, yet accurate patterns in response for patients outside these groups. We take advantage of this information by proposing a mixture-of-experts model that automatically selects between the methods in order to assign the most appropriate therapy choice to an individual. Overall, we verify that therapy combinations proposed using this approach significantly outperform previous methods.},

Existing state-of-the-art MI attacks in black-box settings adopt a so-called shadow model to perform transfer attacks. Such attacks achieve high inference accuracy but have many adversarial assumptions, such as having a dataset from the same distribution as the target model's training data and knowledge of the target model structure. We propose a novel MI attack, called UMIA, which probes the target model in an unsupervised way without any shadow model. We relax all the adversarial assumptions above, demonstrating that MI attacks are applicable without any knowledge about the target model and its training set. We empirically show that, with far fewer adversarial assumptions and computational resources, UMIA can perform on bar with the state-of-the-art supervised MI attack.},

  abstract = {With the wide adoption of handheld devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets), a large number of location-based services (also called LBSs) have flourished providing mobile users with real-time and contextual information on the move. Accounting for the amount of location information they are given by users, these services are able to track users wherever they go and to learn sensitive information about them (e.g., their points of interest including home, work, religious or political places regularly visited). A number of solutions have been proposed in the past few years to protect users location information while still allowing them to enjoy geo-located services. Among the most robust solutions are those that apply the popular notion of differential privacy to location privacy (e.g., Geo-Indistinguishability), promising strong theoretical privacy guarantees with a bounded accuracy loss. While these theoretical guarantees are attracting, it might be difficult for end users or practitioners to assess their effectiveness in the wild. In this paper, we carry on a practical study using real mobility traces coming from two different datasets, to assess the ability of Geo-Indistinguishability to protect users' points of interest (POIs). We show that a curious LBS collecting obfuscated location information sent by mobile users is still able to infer most of the users POIs with a reasonable both geographic and semantic precision. This precision depends on the degree of obfuscation applied by Geo-Indistinguishability. Nevertheless, the latter also has an impact on the overhead incurred on mobile devices resulting in a privacy versus overhead trade-off. Finally, we show in our study that POIs constitute a quasi-identifier for mobile users and that obfuscating them using Geo-Indistinguishability is not sufficient as an attacker is able to re-identify at least 63 \% of them despite a high degree of obfuscation.},

Methods We calculated cardiovascular risk by means of 15 machine-learning methods and using the SCORE and REGICOR scales and in 38 527 patients in the Spanish ESCARVAL RISK cohort, with 5-year follow-up. We considered patients to be at high risk when the risk of a cardiovascular event was over 5\% (according to SCORE and machine learning methods) or over 10\% (using REGICOR). The area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and the C-index were calculated, as well as the diagnostic accuracy rate, error rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, positive likelihood ratio, and number needed to treat to prevent a harmful outcome. Results The method with the greatest predictive capacity was quadratic discriminant analysis, with an AUC of 0.7086, followed by Naive Bayes and neural networks, with AUCs of 0.7084 and 0.7042, respectively. REGICOR and SCORE ranked 11th and 12th, respectively, in predictive capacity, with AUCs of 0.63. Seven machine learning methods showed a 7\% higher predictive capacity (AUC) as well as higher sensitivity and specificity than the REGICOR and SCORE scales. Conclusions Ten of the 15 machine learning methods tested have a better predictive capacity for cardiovascular events and better classification indicators than the SCORE and REGICOR risk assessment scales commonly used in clinical practice in Spain. Machine learning methods should be considered in the development of future cardiovascular risk scales.},

  abstract = {Microservices has emerged as a new architectural style of designing applications to overcome the challenges of service oriented architecture (SOA). With the evolution of microservices architecture, architects have started migrating legacy applications to microservices. However, some of the architects are in chaos whether to migrate the application from SOA to microservices or not. The need for empirical evaluation and comparison of both the SOA and microservices architecture is also on-demand. This work helps the software architects in better understanding of the technical differences between both styles. We, therefore, present a comparison of a web application that is designed using both SOA and microservices architectures. The comparison is presented with two different parameters: 1) complexity with architectural metrics; 2) performance with load testing. It is clear from the results that though the complexity of microservices architecture is high, the response time for processing the requests is very fast compared to SOA services.},

  abstract = {Pattern recognition generally requires that objects be described in terms of a set of measurable features. The selection and quality of the features representing each pattern have a considerable bearing on the success of subsequent pattern classification. Feature extraction is the process of deriving new features from the original features in order to reduce the cost of feature measurement, increase classifier efficiency, and allow higher classification accuracy. Many current feature extraction techniques involve linear transformations of the original pattern vectors to new vectors of lower dimensionality. While this is useful for data visualization and increasing classification efficiency, it does not necessarily reduce the number of features that must be measured since each new feature may be a linear combination of all of the features in the original pattern vector. Here, we present a new approach to feature extraction in which feature selection, feature extraction, and classifier training are performed simultaneously using a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm optimizes a vector of feature weights, which are used to scale the individual features in the original pattern vectors in either a linear or a nonlinear fashion. A masking vector is also employed to perform simultaneous selection of a subset of the features. We employ this technique in combination with the nearest neighbor classification rule, and compare the results with classical feature selection and extraction techniques, including sequential floating forward feature selection, and linear discriminant analysis. We also present results for the identification of favorable water-binding sites on protein surfaces, an important problem in biochemistry and drug design.},

  abstract = {In smartphones several sensors and receivers are embedded which enable positioning in Locationbased Services and other navigation applications. They include GNSS receivers and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) cards as well as inertial sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscope and magnetometer. In this paper, indoor Wi-Fi positioning is studied based on trilateration. Three methods are investigated which are a resection, a calculation of the center of gravity point and a differential approach. The first approach is a commonly employed resection using the ranges to the Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) as radii and intersect the circles around the APs. In the second method, the center of gravity in a triangle of APs is calculated with weighting of the received signal strength (RSS) of the Wi-Fi signals. The third approach is developed by analogy to Differential GNSS (DGNSS) and therefore termed Differential Wi-Fi (DWi-Fi). Its advantage is that a real-time modeling of the temporal RSS variations and fluctuations is possible. For that purpose, reference stations realized by low-cost Raspberry Pi units are deployed which serve at the same time as APs. The experiments conducted in a laboratory and entrance of an office building showed that position deviations from the ground truth of around 2 m are achievable with the second and third method. Thereby the positioning accuracies depend mainly on the geometrical point location in the triangle of APs and reference stations and the RSS scan duration.},

  abstract = {Context: Git is a popular distributed version control system that provides flexibility and robustness for software development projects. Several workflows have been proposed to codify the way project contributors work collaboratively with Git. Some workflows are highly prescriptive while others allow more leeway but do not provide the same level of code quality assurance, thus, preventing their comparison to determine the most suitable for a specific set of requirements, or to ascertain if a workflow is being properly followed. Objective: In this paper, we propose a novel feature-based framework for describing Git workflows, based on a study of 26 existing instances. The framework enables workflows' comparison, to discern how, and to what extent, they exploit Git capabilities for collaborative software development. Methods: The framework uses feature-based modelling to map Git capabilities, regularly expressed as contribution guidelines, and a set of features that can be impartially applied to all the workflows considered. Through this framework, each workflow was characterised based on their publicly available descriptions. The characterisations were then vectorised and processed using hierarchical clustering to determine workflows' similarities and to identify which features are most popular, and more relevant for discriminatory purposes. Results: Comparative analysis evidenced that some workflows claiming to be closely related, when described and then characterised, turned out to have more differences than similarities. The analysis also showed that most workflows focus on the branching and code integration strategies, whilst others emphasise subtle differences from other popular workflows or describe a specific development route and are, thus, widely reused. Conclusion: The characterisation and clustering analysis demonstrated that our framework can be used to compare and analyse Git workflows.},

The responses indicate that with DevOps, practitioners can increase the frequency of releases and improve test automation practices. DevOps was seen to encourage collaboration between departments which boosts communication and employee welfare. Continuous releases enable a more experimental approach and rapid feedback collection. The challenges include communication structures that hinder cross-department collaboration and having to address the cultural shift. Dissimilar development and production environments were mentioned as some of the technical barriers. DevOps might not also be suitable for all industries. Ambiguity in the definition of DevOps makes adoption difficult since organizations might not know which practices they should implement for DevOps.},

As machine learning, federated learning is threatened by adversarial attacks against the integrity of the learning model and the privacy of data via a distributed approach to tackle local and global learning. This weak point is exacerbated by the inaccessibility of data in federated learning, which makes harder the protection against adversarial attacks and evidences the need to furtherance the research on defence methods to make federated learning a real solution for safeguarding data privacy. In this paper, we present an extensive review of the threats of federated learning, as well as as their corresponding countermeasures, attacks versus defences. This survey provides a taxonomy of adversarial attacks and a taxonomy of defence methods that depict a general picture of this vulnerability of federated learning and how to overcome it. Likewise, we expound guidelines for selecting the most adequate defence method according to the category of the adversarial attack. Besides, we carry out an extensive experimental study from which we draw further conclusions about the behaviour of attacks and defences and the guidelines for selecting the most adequate defence method according to the category of the adversarial attack.

  abstract = {Centralized Version Control Systems have been used by many open source projects for a long time. However, in recent years several widely-known projects have migrated their repositories to Distributed Version Control Systems, such as Mercurial, Bazaar, and Git. Such systems have technical features that allow contributors to work in new ways, as various different workflows are possible. We plan to study this migration process to assess how developers' organization and their contributions are affected. As a first step, we present an analysis of the Mozilla repositories, which migrated from CVS to Mercurial in 2007. This analysis reveals both expected and unexpected aspects of the contributors' activities.}

The authorized user initially enters a number of user training samples on a keyboard. The user training samples are then purified to eliminate training samples which are different from other training samples. The purification can be performed by a self-organizing neural network which has input thereto, authorized user training samples, or both authorized training samples and imposter training samples. The purified user training samples are then compared to a sample to be tested to determine whether the sample is from an authorized user or an imposter. The comparison of the purified samples with the sample to be tested can be performed by a neural network such as a back propagation trained network, an ADALINE unit, a distance method or a linear classifier, discriminate function, or piecewise linear classifier. The result of this testing step indicates whether the user is authorized or an imposter and the user can be granted or denied access to the system.},

  abstract = {Adjusted for chance measures are widely used to compare partitions/clusterings of the same data set. In particular, the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) based on pair-counting, and the Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) based on Shannon information theory are very popular in the clustering community. Nonetheless it is an open problem as to what are the best application scenarios for each measure and guidelines in the literature for their usage are sparse, with the result that users often resort to using both. Generalized Information Theoretic (IT) measures based on the Tsallis entropy have been shown to link pair-counting and Shannon IT measures. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between adjustment of measures based on pair-counting and measures based on information theory. We solve the key technical challenge of analytically computing the expected value and variance of generalized IT measures. This allows us to propose adjustments of generalized IT measures, which reduce to well known adjusted clustering comparison measures as special cases. Using the theory of generalized IT measures, we are able to propose the following guidelines for using ARI and AMI as external validation indices: ARI should be used when the reference clustering has large equal sized clusters; AMI should be used when the reference clustering is unbalanced and there exist small clusters.},

  abstract = {We reviewed the claims made by Adrian et al., in [1] that precomputation of specific DH groups provides the NSA with the ability of mass surveillance of Internet communications and passively eavesdropping to large percentage of IPSec and TLS connections. We have independently reached essentially the same conclusions as Wouters in [2], namely, that the success rate of a hypothetical NSA attack on IPSec, would be much lower than the original estimate which appeared in [1]. More interestingly, we also checked the claimed statistics in [1] related to HTTPS connections (which was not checked by Wouters). These connections use the TLS protocol (or its predecessor SSL) to securely access HTTP servers on the Internet, and is of great interest to intelligence services since it protects access to search engines (such as GOOGLE), to email (such as GMAIL), to social networks (such as FACEBOOK), to financial information (such as CITIBANK and VISA) and to various services (such as ordering books on AMAZON or reserving airline tickets on EXPEDIA). Our independent tests show that even massive precomputation applied to all DH groups will have very limited success in passively breaking interesting HTTPS connections, which are used to access the most popular sites on the web. We have also found several methodological problems in the current implementation and interpretation of Internet wide HTTPS scans by based on the ZMap scanning software [3] used for generating the statistics shown in [1] and in the DROWN attack paper by Aviram et al., [4]. For example not implementing support of URL redirection caused many sites to be excluded from the scans, while not implementing host name validation cause mis-configured sites to be considered as valid sites that will be trusted by browsers. We have also reviewed the Snowden documents referenced by [1]. In those and other Snowden documents we have found clues that the NSA use other attack vectors to decrypt IPSec and TLS traffic. The recent Juniper and Cisco back-door revelations support this hypothesis.},

Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for "border matting" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools.},

It is made of three main steps : first a splitting procedure for the subdivision of clusters into two subclusters, second a local evaluation of the bipartitions resulting from the tentative splits and, third, a formula for determining the nodes levels of the resulting dendrogram. A number of such algorithms is given. These algorithms are compared using the Goodman-Kruskal correlation coefficient. As a global criterion it is an internal goodness-of-fit measure based on the set order induced by the hierarchy compared to the order associated to the given dissimilarities. Applied to a hundred of random data tables, these comparisons are in favor of two methods based on unusual ratio-type formulas for the splitting procedures, namely the Silhouette criterion and Dunn's criterion. These two criteria take into account both the within cluster and the between cluster mean dissimilarity. In general the results of these two algorithms are better than the classical Agglomerative Average Link method.},

The purpose of such a forecast is to provide the company with an opportunity to reach out to such clients as an effort to ensure their retention. We work with monthly records of client transactions: each client is represented as a series of purchases and consumptions. We vary (1) the length of the time period used to make the forecast, (2) the length of a period of inactivity after which a client is assumed to be lost, and (3) how far in advance the forecast is made. Our experimental work finds that current machine-learning techniques able to adequately predict, well in advance, which clients will be lost.

  abstract = {While the application of machine-learning algorithms has been highly simplified in the last years due to their well-documented integration in commonly used statistical programming languages (such as R or Python), there are several practical challenges in the field of ecological modeling related to unbiased performance estimation. One is the influence of spatial autocorrelation in both hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation. Grouped cross-validation strategies have been proposed in recent years in environmental as well as medical contexts to reduce bias in predictive performance. In this study we show the effects of spatial autocorrelation on hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation by comparing several widely used machine-learning algorithms such as boosted regression trees (BRT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) with traditional parametric algorithms such as logistic regression (GLM) and semi-parametric ones like generalized additive models (GAM) in terms of predictive performance. Spatial and non-spatial cross-validation methods were used to evaluate model performances aiming to obtain bias-reduced performance estimates. A detailed analysis on the sensitivity of hyperparameter tuning when using different resampling methods (spatial/non-spatial) was performed. As a case study the spatial distribution of forest disease (Diplodia sapinea) in the Basque Country (Spain) was investigated using common environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, soil and lithology as predictors. Random Forest (mean Brier score estimate of 0.166) outperformed all other methods with regard to predictive accuracy. Though the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning differed between the ML algorithms, there were in most cases no substantial differences between spatial and non-spatial partitioning for hyperparameter tuning. However, spatial hyperparameter tuning maintains consistency with spatial estimation of classifier performance and should be favored over non-spatial hyperparameter optimization. High performance differences (up to 47\%) between the bias-reduced (spatial cross-validation) and overoptimistic (non-spatial cross-validation) cross-validation settings showed the high need to account for the influence of spatial autocorrelation. Overoptimistic performance estimates may lead to false actions in ecological decision making based on biased model predictions.},

We will also discuss the relationship of DBSCAN performance and the indexability of the dataset, and discuss some heuristics for choosing appropriate DBSCAN parameters. Some indicators of bad parameters will be proposed to help guide future users of this algorithm in choosing parameters such as to obtain both meaningful results and good performance. In new experiments, we show that the new SIGMOD 2015 methods do not appear to offer practical benefits if the DBSCAN parameters are well chosen and thus they are primarily of theoretical interest. In conclusion, the original DBSCAN algorithm with effective indexes and reasonably chosen parameter values performs competitively compared to the method proposed by Gan and Tao.},

  abstract = {Account sharing refers to a situation where multiple individuals share a Web site account to avoid paying a fee or providing personal information. As a result of account sharing, service providers lose revenue, underestimate membership, and have impaired understanding of their customers. A generic framework for detecting account sharing is proposed, using keystroke dynamics. Starting with the observation that a user's keystroke patterns are consistent and distinct from those of other individuals, it is assumed that each user's keystroke patterns form a "cluster" in Euclidean space. The number of sharers can be estimated by the number of clusters. In this paper, the "optimal" number of clusters is estimated based on the Bayesian model-selection framework with Gaussian mixture models obtained using the variational Bayesian approach. In a case study involving 25 passwords and 16 users, the proposed approach performed well in "sharing detection," with a 2 percent false alarm rate, a 2 percent miss rate, and a "total user estimation" error of 7 percent. The proposed approach is viable and merits further investigation.},

We aim to reach the result more efficiently than running HACA again from scratch on the feature-extended object set. Experiments testing the method's efficiency and a practical distributed systems problem in which the HAC method can be efficiently used (the problem of adaptive horizontal fragmentation in object oriented databases) are also reported.},

With the increasing interest in the literature on continuous practices, it is important to systematically review and synthesize the approaches, tools, challenges, and practices reported for adopting and implementing continuous practices. This paper aimed at systematically reviewing the state of the art of continuous practices to classify approaches and tools, identify challenges and practices in this regard, and identify the gaps for future research. We used the systematic literature review method for reviewing the peer-reviewed papers on continuous practices published between 2004 and June 1, 2016. We applied the thematic analysis method for analyzing the data extracted from reviewing 69 papers selected using predefined criteria. We have identified 30 approaches and associated tools, which facilitate the implementation of continuous practices in the following ways: (1) reducing build and test time in continuous integration (CI); (2) increasing visibility and awareness on build and test results in CI; (3) supporting (semi-) automated continuous testing; (4) detecting violations, flaws, and faults in CI; (5) addressing security and scalability issues in deployment pipeline; and (6) improving dependability and reliability of deployment process. We have also determined a list of critical factors, such as testing (effort and time), team awareness and transparency, good design principles, customer, highly skilled and motivated team, application domain, and appropriate infrastructure that should be carefully considered when introducing continuous practices in a given organization. The majority of the reviewed papers were validation (34.7\%) and evaluation (36.2\%) research types. This paper also reveals that continuous practices have been successfully applied to both greenfield and maintenance projects. Continuous practices have become an important area of software engineering research and practice. While the reported approaches, tools, and practices are addressing a wide range of challenges, there are several challenges and gaps, which require future research work for improving the capturing and reporting of contextual information in the studies reporting different aspects of continuous practices; gaining a deep understanding of how software-intensive systems should be (re-) architected to support continuous practices; and addressing the lack of knowledge and tools for engineering processes of designing and running secure deployment pipelines.},

Software developers rarely divulge development knowledge about the software to operators, while operators rarely communicate field knowledge to developers. To improve the quality and reduce the operational cost of large-scale software systems, bridging the gap between these two worlds is essential. This thesis proposes the use of logs as mechanism to bridge the gap between these two worlds. Logs are messages generated from statements inserted by developers in the source code and are often used by operators for monitoring the field operation of a system. However, the rich knowledge in logs has not yet been fully used because of their non-structured nature, their large scale, and the use of the ad hoc log analysis techniques. Through case studies on large commercial and open source systems, we plan to demonstrate the value of logs as a tool to support developers and operators.},

Since it is so hard to break even for a computer, it becomes important to do encryption for all the secure transactions. Although it lies outside the capabilities of traditional computing, the recent developments in the field of quantum computing can be utilised to break RSA Encryption. The approach involves mapping of qubits used in a quantum machine to a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and then using them to check for factors. This consists of the use of a Multiplicative Boolean circuit in which the qubits utilised by the machine replaces the variables. These Qubits are then mapped as per the gates involved, and the factorization problem is thus transformed into a CSP pro\- blem, through which, the factors can be easily found. Once known, these factors can be used to calculate the public and private keys effectively breaking the encryption security. We provide a novel approach to highlight the importance of developing Post-Quantum cryptography techniques for pro\- viding a secure channel of communication.},

Such privacy, however, comes at the cost of degrading the utility of the underlying LBSes. The main body of previous work has used a generic distance-only based metric to quantify the quality loss incurred while employing LPPMs. In this paper, we argue that using such generic utility metrics misleads the design and evaluation of LPPMs, since generic utility metrics do not capture the actual utility perceived by the users. We demonstrate this for ride-hailing services, a popular class of LBS with complex utility behavior. Specifically, we design a privacy-preserving ride-hailing service, called PRide, and demonstrate the significant distinction between its generic and tailored metrics. Through various experiments we show the significant implications of using generic utility metrics in the design and evaluation of LPPMs. Our work concludes that LPPM design and evaluation should use utility metrics that are tailored to the individual LBSes.},

We focus on the basic membership inference attack: given a data record and black-box access to a model, determine if the record was in the model's training dataset. To perform membership inference against a target model, we make adversarial use of machine learning and train our own inference model to recognize differences in the target model's predictions on the inputs that it trained on versus the inputs that it did not train on. We empirically evaluate our inference techniques on classification models trained by commercial "machine learning as a service" providers such as Google and Amazon. Using realistic datasets and classification tasks, including a hospital discharge dataset whose membership is sensitive from the privacy perspective, we show that these models can be vulnerable to membership inference attacks. We then investigate the factors that influence this leakage and evaluate mitigation strategies.},

We address the need for capacity development in this area by providing a conceptual introduction to machine learning alongside a practical guide to developing and evaluating predictive algorithms using freely-available open source software and public domain data. Methods: We demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques by developing three predictive models for cancer diagnosis using descriptions of nuclei sampled from breast masses. These algorithms include regularized General Linear Model regression (GLMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a radial basis function kernel, and single-layer Artificial Neural Networks. The publicly-available dataset describing the breast mass samples (N = 683) was randomly split into evaluation (n = 456) and validation (n = 227) samples. We trained algorithms on data from the evaluation sample before they were used to predict the diagnostic outcome in the validation dataset. We compared the predictions made on the validation datasets with the real-world diagnostic decisions to calculate the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the three models. We explored the use of averaging and voting ensembles to improve predictive performance. We provide a step-by-step guide to developing algorithms using the open-source R statistical programming environment. Results: The trained algorithms were able to classify cell nuclei with high accuracy (.94 - .96), sensitivity (.97 - .99), and specificity (.85 - .94). Maximum accuracy (.96) and area under the curve (.97) was achieved using the SVM algorithm. Prediction performance increased marginally (accuracy=.97, sensitivity = .99, specificity = .95) when algorithms were arranged into a voting ensemble. Conclusions: We use a straightforward example to demonstrate the theory and practice of machine learning for clinicians and medical researchers. The principals which we demonstrate here can be readily applied to other complex tasks including natural language processing and image recognition.},

It is formulated as a query-response method, and computationally achieved by output perturbation. Several noise-addition methods to implement such output perturbation have been proposed in the literature. We focus on data-independent noise, that is, noise whose distribution is constant across data sets. Our goal is to find the optimal data-independent noise distribution to achieve {$\epsilon$}-differential privacy. We propose a general optimality criterion based on the concentration of the probability mass of the noise distribution around zero, and we show that any noise optimal under this criterion must be optimal under any other sensible criterion. We also show that the Laplace distribution, commonly used for noise in {$\epsilon$}-differential privacy, is not optimal, and we build the optimal data-independent noise distribution. We compare the Laplace and the optimal data-independent noise distributions. For univariate query functions, both introduce a similar level of distortion; for multivariate query functions, optimal data-independent noise offers responses with substantially better data quality.},

Among existing post-quantum candidates, signature schemes generally have larger public key/signature sizes compared to the public key/ciphertext sizes of KEMs: by using an IND-CCA-secure KEM for server authentication in post-quantum TLS, we obtain multiple benefits. A size-optimized post-quantum instantiation of KEMTLS requires less than half the bandwidth of a size-optimized post-quantum instantiation of TLS 1.3. In a speed-optimized instantiation, KEMTLS reduces the amount of server CPU cycles by almost 90\% compared to TLS 1.3, while at the same time reducing communication size, reducing the time until the client can start sending encrypted application data, and eliminating code for signatures from the server's trusted code base.Updated measurements with NIST Round-3 schemes as well as small fixes to the security sketch for mutual auth.

  abstract = {The current trend of building web applications using microservice architectures is based on the domain-driven design (DDD) concept, as described by Evans. Among practitioners, DDD is a widely accepted approach to building applications. Applying and extending the concepts and tasks of DDD is challenging because it lacks a software development process description and classification within existing software development process approaches. For these reasons, we provide a brief overview of a DDD-based software development process for building resource-oriented microservices that takes into consideration the requirements of the desired application. Following the widely accepted engineering approach suggested by Bru\textasciidieresis{} gge et al., the emphasis is on the analysis, design, implementation and testing phases. Furthermore, we classify DDD and microservice-based application into regular software development activities and software architecture concepts. After the process is described, it is applied to a case study in order to demonstrate its potential applications and limitations.},

  author = {Strehl, Alexander and Ghosh, Joydeep},
  abstract = {This paper introduces the problem of combining multiple partitionings of a set of objects into a single consolidated clustering without accessing the features or algorithms that determined these partitionings. We first identify several application scenarios for the resultant `knowledge reuse' framework that we call cluster ensembles. The cluster ensemble problem is then formalized as a combinatorial optimization problem in terms of shared mutual information. In addition to a direct maximization approach, we propose three effective and efficient techniques for obtaining high-quality combiners (consensus functions). The first combiner induces a similarity measure from the partitionings and then reclusters the objects. The second combiner is based on hypergraph partitioning. The third one collapses groups of clusters into meta-clusters which then compete for each object to determine the combined clustering. Due to the low computational costs of our techniques, it is quite feasible to use a supra-consensus function that evaluates all three approaches against the objective function and picks the best solution for a given situation. We evaluate the effectiveness of cluster ensembles in three qualitatively different application scenarios: (i) where the original clusters were formed based on non-identical sets of features, (ii) where the original clustering algorithms worked on non-identical sets of objects, and (iii) where a common data-set is used and the main purpose of combining multiple clusterings is to improve the quality and robustness of the solution. Promising results are obtained in all three situations for synthetic as well as real data-sets.},

Based on the modified encoding mechanism, we propose kCluster algorithm that can be used for clustering in the anonymized space. We show the modified encoding mechanism can be easily implemented in existing clustering algorithms that only rely on distance information, such as DBSCAN.

However, the problem of the sensitive information leakage and the associated security risk with the applications of clustering methods is rarely considered. To address the problem, we proposed differential privacy-preserving density peaks' clustering based on the shared near neighbors similarity method in this paper. First, the Euclidean distance and the shared near neighbors similarity were combined to define the local density of a sample, and the Laplace noise was added to the local density and the shortest distance to protect privacy. Second, the process of cluster center selection was optimized to select the initial cluster centers based on the neighborhood information. Finally, each sample was assigned to the cluster as its nearest neighbor with higher local density. The experimental results on both the UCI and synthetic datasets show that compared with other algorithms, our method more effectively protects the data privacy and improves the quality of the clustering results.},

Although many state-of-the-art and complex techniques are excellent at partitioning an input image to facilitate deriving a semantic description of the scene, to achieve seamless image synthesis, we advocate a segmentation approach designed to maintain spatial and color coherence among soft segments while preserving discontinuities by assigning to each pixel a set of soft labels corresponding to their respective color distributions. We optimize a global objective function, which simultaneously exploits the reliability given by global color statistics and flexibility of local image compositing, leading to an image model where the global color statistics of an image is represented by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), whereas the color of a pixel is explained by a local color mixture model where the weights are defined by the soft labels to the elements of the converged GMM. Transparency is naturally introduced in our probabilistic framework, which infers an optimal mixture of colors at an image pixel. To adequately consider global and local information in the same framework, an alternating optimization scheme is proposed to iteratively solve for the global and local model parameters. Our method is fully automatic and is shown to converge to a good optimal solution. We perform extensive evaluation and comparison and demonstrate that our method achieves good image synthesis results for image-based applications such as image matting, color transfer, image deblurring, and image colorization.},

Production of wind power cannot be controlled as the wind speed can vary based on weather conditions. Accurate prediction of wind power can assist smart grid that intelligently decides on the usage of alternative power sources based on demand forecast. Time series wind speed data are normally used for wind power prediction. In this paper, we have investigated the usage of a set of secondary features obtained using deep learning for wind power prediction. Deep learning is a special form on neural network that is capable of capturing the structural properties of time series data in terms of a set of numeric features. More precisely, we have designed a two-stage autoencoder (a particular type of deep learning) and incorporated the structural features into a prediction framework. Using the structural features, we have achieved as high as 12.63\% better prediction accuracy than traditionally used statistical features.},

We capitalize four types of latency as keystroke feature and two methods to calculate the similarity scores between the two given latency. A two layer fusion approach is proposed to enhance the overall performance of the system to achieve near 1.401\% Equal Error Rate (EER). We also introduce two additional modules to increase the flexibility of the proposed system. These modules aim to accommodate exceptional cases, for instance, when a legitimate user is unable to provide his or her normal typing pattern due to reasons such as hand injury. \'O 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerous studies have been conducted in terms of data acquisition devices, feature representations, classification methods, experimental protocols, and evaluations. However, an up-to-date extensive survey and evaluation is not yet available. The objective of this paper is to provide an insightful survey and comparison on keystroke dynamics biometrics research performed throughout the last three decades, as well as offering suggestions and possible future research directions.},

Existing LDP protocols are developed primarily to ensure data privacy in the collection of single numerical or categorical values, such as click count in Web access logs. However, in federated learning model parameter updates are collected iteratively from each participant and consist of high dimensional, continuous values with high precision (10s of digits after the decimal point), making existing LDP protocols inapplicable. To address this challenge in LDP-Fed, we design and develop two novel approaches. First, LDP-Fed's LDP Module provides a formal differential privacy guarantee for the repeated collection of model training parameters in the federated training of large-scale neural networks over multiple individual participants' private datasets. Second, LDP-Fed implements a suite of selection and filtering techniques for perturbing and sharing select parameter updates with the parameter server. We validate our system deployed with a condensed LDP protocol in training deep neural networks on public data. We compare this version of LDP-Fed, coined CLDP-Fed, with other state-of-the-art approaches with respect to model accuracy, privacy preservation, and system capabilities.},

  abstract = {A Unix domain socket or IPC socket (inter-process communication socket) is a data communications endpoint for exchanging data between processes executing on the same host operating system. Like named pipes, Unix domain sockets support transmission of a reliable stream of bytes (SOCK\_STREAM, compare to TCP).  In addition, they support ordered and reliable transmission of datagrams (SOCK\_SEQPACKET, compare to SCTP), or unordered and unreliable transmission of datagrams (SOCK\_DGRAM, compare to UDP).  The Unix domain socket facility is a standard component of POSIX operating systems. The API for Unix domain sockets is similar to that of an Internet socket, but rather than using an underlying network protocol, all communication occurs entirely within the operating system kernel.  Unix domain sockets use the file system as their address name space. Processes reference Unix domain sockets as file system inodes, so two processes can communicate by opening the same socket. In addition to sending data, processes may send file descriptors across a Unix domain socket connection using the sendmsg() and recvmsg() system calls. This allows the sending processes to grant the receiving process access to a file descriptor for which the receiving process otherwise does not have access.  This can be used to implement a rudimentary form of capability-based security. For example, this allows the Clam AntiVirus scanner to run as an unprivileged daemon on Linux and BSD, yet still read any file sent to the daemon's Unix domain socket.},

There appears to be some confusion among researchers, however, about best practices for cross-validation, and about the interpretation of cross-validation results. In particular, repeated cross-validation is often advocated, and so is the reporting of standard deviations, confidence intervals, or an indication of "significance". In this paper, we argue that, under many practical circumstances, when the goal of the experiments is to see how well the model returned by a learner will perform in practice in a particular domain, repeated cross-validation is not useful, and the reporting of confidence intervals or significance is misleading. Our arguments are supported by experimental results.},

Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with}

Results indicate that the keystroke biometric can accurately identify an individual who sends inappropriate email (free text) if sufficient enrollment samples are available and if the same type of keyboard is used to produce the enrollment and questioned samples. For laptop keyboards we obtained 99.5\% accuracy on 36 users, which decreased to 97.9\% on a larger population of 47 users.

In this paper, we discuss the necessity of correction for chance for information theoretic based measures for clusterings comparison. We observe that the baseline for such measures, i.e. average value between random partitions of a data set, does not take on a constant value, and tends to have larger variation when the ratio between the number of data points and the number of clusters is small. This effect is similar in some other non-information theoretic based measures such as the well-known Rand Index. Assuming a hypergeometric model of randomness, we derive the analytical formula for the expected mutual information value between a pair of clusterings, and then propose the adjusted version for several popular information theoretic based measures. Some examples are given to demonstrate the need and usefulness of the adjusted measures.},

  abstract = {Local differential privacy (LDP) is a recently proposed privacy standard for collecting and analyzing data, which has been used, e.g., in the Chrome browser, iOS and macOS. In LDP, each user perturbs her information locally, and only sends the randomized version to an aggregator who performs analyses, which protects both the users and the aggregator against private information leaks. Although LDP has attracted much research attention in recent years, the majority of existing work focuses on applying LDP to complex data and/or analysis tasks. In this paper, we point out that the fundamental problem of collecting multidimensional data under LDP has not been addressed sufficiently, and there remains much room for improvement even for basic tasks such as computing the mean value over a single numeric attribute under LDP. Motivated by this, we first propose novel LDP mechanisms for collecting a numeric attribute, whose accuracy is at least no worse (and usually better) than existing solutions in terms of worst-case noise variance. Then, we extend these mechanisms to multidimensional data that can contain both numeric and categorical attributes, where our mechanisms always outperform existing solutions regarding worst-case noise variance. As a case study, we apply our solutions to build an LDP-compliant stochastic gradient descent algorithm (SGD), which powers many important machine learning tasks. Experiments using real datasets confirm the effectiveness of our methods, and their advantages over existing solutions.},

  abstract = {Collecting and analyzing massive data generated from smart devices have become increasingly pervasive in crowdsensing, which are the building blocks for data-driven decision-making. However, extensive statistics and analysis of such data will seriously threaten the privacy of participating users. Local differential privacy (LDP) was proposed as an excellent and prevalent privacy model with distributed architecture, which can provide strong privacy guarantees for each user while collecting and analyzing data. LDP ensures that each user\&rsquo;s data is locally perturbed first in the client-side and then sent to the server-side, thereby protecting data from privacy leaks on both the client-side and server-side. This survey presents a comprehensive and systematic overview of LDP with respect to privacy models, research tasks, enabling mechanisms, and various applications. Specifically, we first provide a theoretical summarization of LDP, including the LDP model, the variants of LDP, and the basic framework of LDP algorithms. Then, we investigate and compare the diverse LDP mechanisms for various data statistics and analysis tasks from the perspectives of frequency estimation, mean estimation, and machine learning. Furthermore, we also summarize practical LDP-based application scenarios. Finally, we outline several future research directions under LDP.},

  abstract = {Protocols satisfying Local Differential Privacy (LDP) enable parties to collect aggregate information about a population while protecting each user's privacy, without relying on a trusted third party. LDP protocols (such as Google's RAPPOR) have been deployed in real-world scenarios. In these protocols, a user encodes his private information and perturbs the encoded value locally before sending it to an aggregator, who combines values that users contribute to infer statistics about the population. In this paper, we introduce a framework that generalizes several LDP protocols proposed in the literature. Our framework yields a simple and fast aggregation algorithm, whose accuracy can be precisely analyzed. Our in-depth analysis enables us to choose optimal parameters, resulting in two new protocols (i.e., Optimized Unary Encoding and Optimized Local Hashing) that provide better utility than protocols previously proposed. We present precise conditions for when each proposed protocol should be used, and perform experiments that demonstrate the advantage of our proposed protocols.},

  abstract = {In unsupervised machine learning, agreement between partitions is commonly assessed with so-called external validity indices. Researchers tend to use and report indices that quantify agreement between two partitions for all clusters simultaneously. Commonly used examples are the Rand index and the adjusted Rand index. Since these overall measures give a general notion of what is going on, their values are usually hard to interpret. The goal of this study is to provide a thorough understanding of the adjusted Rand index as well as many other partition comparison indices based on counting object pairs. It is shown that many overall indices based on the pair-counting approach can be decomposed into indices that reflect the degree of agreement on the level of individual clusters. The decompositions (1) show that the overall indices can be interpreted as summary statistics of the agreement on the cluster level, (2) specify how these overall indices are related to the indices for individual clusters, and (3) show that the overall indices are affected by cluster size imbalance: if cluster sizes are unbalanced these overall measures will primarily reflect the degree of agreement between the partitions on the large clusters, and will provide much less information on the agreement on smaller clusters. Furthermore, the value of Rand-like indices is determined to a large extent by the number of pairs of objects that are not joined in either of the partitions.}

After the initial definition the template can be registered against an individual body scan and the landmarks can be transferred to the scan using our second proposed algorithm.

The data-mining method random forests (RF) can handle high dimensions; however, in high-dimensional data, RF is not an effective filter for identifying risk factors associated with the disease trait via complex genetic models such as gene\textendash gene interactions without strong marginal components. In this article we propose an extension called weighted random forests (wRF), which incorporates tree-level weights to emphasize more accurate trees in prediction and calculation of variable importance. We demonstrate through simulation and application to data from a genetic study of addiction that wRF can outperform RF in high-dimensional data, although the improvements are modest and limited to situations with effect sizes that are larger than what is realistic in genetics of complex disease. Thus, the current implementation of wRF is unlikely to improve detection of relevant predictors in high-dimensional genetic data, but may be applicable in other situations where larger effect sizes are anticipated. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Nevertheless, since such data often contain sensitive information. In this paper, we propose the first locally differentially private K-means mechanism under this distributed scenario. Differing from standard differentially private clustering mechanisms, the proposed mechanism doesn't need any trusted third party to collect and preprocess users data. Our mechanism first perturbs users data locally to satisfy local differential privacy~(LDP). Then it revises the traditional K-means algorithm to allow the service provider to obtain high-quality clustering results by collaborating with users based on the highly perturbed data. We prove that our mechanism can enable high utility clustering while guaranteeing local differential privacy for each user. We also propose an extended mechanism to improve our basic model in terms of privacy and utility. In this mechanism, we perturb both users' sensitive data and the intermediate results of users' clusters in each iteration. Moreover, we consider a more general setting where the users may have different privacy requirements. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets, and the results show that our proposal can well preserve the quality of clustering results.},

Clustering, as the basic composition of data analysis, plays a significant role. On one hand, many tools for cluster analysis have been created, along with the information increase and subject intersection. On the other hand, each clustering algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses, due to the complexity of information. In this review paper, we begin at the definition of clustering, take the basic elements involved in the clustering process, such as the distance or similarity measurement and evaluation indicators, into consideration, and analyze the clustering algorithms from two perspectives, the traditional ones and the modern ones. All the discussed clustering algorithms will be compared in detail and comprehensively shown in Appendix Table~22.}

  abstract = {With the development of information technology, a mass of data are generated every day. Collecting and analysing these data help service providers improve their services and gain an advantage in the fierce market competition. K-means clustering has been widely used for cluster analysis in real life. However, these analyses are based on users' data, which disclose users' privacy. Local differential privacy has attracted lots of attention recently due to its strong privacy guarantee and has been applied for clustering analysis. However, existing K-means clustering methods with local differential privacy protection cannot get an ideal clustering result due to the large amount of noise introduced to the whole dataset to ensure the privacy guarantee. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method that provides local distance privacy for users who participate in the clustering analysis. Instead of making the users' records in-distinguish from each other in high-dimensional space, we map the user's record into a one-dimensional distance space and make the records in such a distance space not be distinguished from each other. To be specific, we generate a noisy distance first and then synthesise the high-dimensional data record. We propose a Bounded Laplace Method (BLM) and a Cluster Indistinguishable Method (CIM) to sample such a noisy distance, which satisfies the local differential privacy guarantee and local dE -privacy guarantee, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a way to generate synthetic data records in high-dimensional space. Our experimental evaluation results show that our methods outperform the traditional methods significantly.},

As an increasing number of users are growing concerned about their personal information, privacy preservation has become an urgent problem to be solved and has attracted significant attention. Local differential privacy (LDP), as a strong privacy tool, has been widely deployed in the real world in recent years. It breaks the shackles of the trusted third party, and allows users to perturb their data locally, thus providing much stronger privacy protection. This survey provides a comprehensive and structured overview of the local differential privacy technology. We summarise and analyze state-of-the-art research in LDP and compare a range of methods in the context of answering a variety of queries and training different machine learning models. We discuss the practical deployment of local differential privacy and explore its application in various domains. Furthermore, we point out several research gaps, and discuss promising future research directions.},

  abstract = {Machine learning algorithms, when applied to sensitive data, pose a distinct threat to privacy. A growing body of prior work demonstrates that models produced by these algorithms may leak specific private information in the training data to an attacker, either through the models' structure or their observable behavior. However, the underlying cause of this privacy risk is not well understood beyond a handful of anecdotal accounts that suggest overfitting and influence might play a role. This paper examines the effect that overfitting and influence have on the ability of an attacker to learn information about the training data from machine learning models, either through training set membership inference or attribute inference attacks. Using both formal and empirical analyses, we illustrate a clear relationship between these factors and the privacy risk that arises in several popular machine learning algorithms. We find that overfitting is sufficient to allow an attacker to perform membership inference and, when the target attribute meets certain conditions about its influence, attribute inference attacks. Interestingly, our formal analysis also shows that overfitting is not necessary for these attacks and begins to shed light on what other factors may be in play. Finally, we explore the connection between membership inference and attribute inference, showing that there are deep connections between the two that lead to effective new attacks.},

Prior work does not adequately address the problem of large datasets and minimization of I/O costs.This paper presents a data clustering method named BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies), and demonstrates that it is especially suitable for very large databases. BIRCH incrementally and dynamically clusters incoming multi-dimensional metric data points to try to produce the best quality clustering with the available resources (i.e., available memory and time constraints). BIRCH can typically find a good clustering with a single scan of the data, and improve the quality further with a few additional scans. BIRCH is also the first clustering algorithm proposed in the database area to handle "noise" (data points that are not part of the underlying pattern) effectively.We evaluate BIRCH's time/space efficiency, data input order sensitivity, and clustering quality through several experiments. We also present a performance comparisons of BIRCH versus CLARANS, a clustering method proposed recently for large datasets, and show that BIRCH is consistently superior.},

Among extant imputation techniques, kNN imputation algorithm is the best one as it is a model free and efficient compared with other methods. However, the value of k must be chosen properly in using kNN imputation. In particular, when some nearest neighbors are far from a missing data, the kNN imputation algorithms are often of low efficiency. In this paper, a new imputation framework is designed. The imputation uses the left or right nearest neighbor for a missing data in a given dataset. Furthermore, a parimputation (partially imputation) strategy is proposed for dealing with the issue of missing data imputation. Specifically, some missing data are imputed when there are some complete data in a small neighborhood of the missing data and, other missing data without imputation are given up in applications, such as data mining and machine learning.},

  abstract = {With an increase in low-cost machine learning APIs, advanced machine learning models may be trained on private datasets and monetized by providing them as a service. However, privacy researchers have demonstrated that these models may leak information about records in the training dataset via membership inference attacks. In this paper, we take a closer look at another inference attack reported in literature, called attribute inference, whereby an attacker tries to infer missing attributes of a partially known record used in the training dataset by accessing the machine learning model as an API. We show that even if a classification model succumbs to membership inference attacks, it is unlikely to be susceptible to attribute inference attacks. We demonstrate that this is because membership inference attacks fail to distinguish a member from a nearby non-member. We call the ability of an attacker to distinguish the two (similar) vectors as strong membership inference. We show that membership inference attacks cannot infer membership in this strong setting, and hence inferring attributes is infeasible. However, under a relaxed notion of attribute inference, called approximate attribute inference, we show that it is possible to infer attributes close to the true attributes. We verify our results on three publicly available datasets, five membership, and three attribute inference attacks reported in literature.},

  abstract = {Data holders are increasingly seeking to protect their user's privacy, whilst still maximizing their ability to produce machine models with high quality predictions. In this work, we empirically evaluate various implementations of differential privacy (DP), and measure their ability to fend off real-world privacy attacks, in addition to measuring their core goal of providing accurate classifications. We establish an evaluation framework to ensure each of these implementations are fairly evaluated. Our selection of DP implementations add DP noise at different positions within the framework, either at the point of data collection/release, during updates while training of the model, or after training by perturbing learned model parameters. We evaluate each implementation across a range of privacy budgets, and datasets, each implementation providing the same mathematical privacy guarantees. By measuring the models' resistance to real world attacks of membership and attribute inference, and their classification accuracy. we determine which implementations provide the most desirable tradeoff between privacy and utility. We found that the number of classes of a given dataset is unlikely to influence where the privacy and utility tradeoff occurs. Additionally, in the scenario that high privacy constraints are required, perturbing input training data does not trade off as much utility, as compared to noise added later in the ML process.},
