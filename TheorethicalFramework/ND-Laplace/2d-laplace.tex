\section{2D-Laplace}
The theory for this subject is heavily inspired by the paper that was written by Andrés et al. \citep{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1212-1984}.
This notion of \gls{gi} was introduced to solve the issue of privacy and location data.
It offers an alternative approach for differential privacy by adding noise to the location locally before sending it to a location-based system (LBS) like Google maps.
This section starts with an introduction to mathematics for the planar and polar Laplace algorithm.
For each of the different subsections, we visualize and explain open challenges and theoretic for applying them for clustering.

\subsection*{Geo-indistinguishability}
As mentioned in the previous section, the \gls{gi} method can be applied to preserve the privacy using a differential privacy method specific to spatial data.
The formula to measure if an algorithm preserves $\epsilon$-geo-indistinguishability can be expressed as \citep{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1212-1984}:
\begin{equation}
  K(x)(y) \le e^{\epsilon * d(x,x`)} K(x`)(y)
  \label{algo:2d-geo-indistinguishability}
\end{equation}
Where $K$ is a probability method reporting $x, x` \in X$ as $z \in Z$.
The idea of this algorithm looks a lot like that of differential privacy using the La Place method; but includes distance.
The intuition for this is that it displays the distinguishability level between two secret locations/points $x$ and $x`$ \citep{chatzikokolakis_constructing_2015}.
An extension of this is called $d_x$-privacy and is a more general notation of distance-aware differential privacy.
Their definition for \gls{gi} is, therefore, $d_2$-privacy, but is essentially the same as the proof provided for \gls{gi}.

\subsection{Planar and polar Laplace}
\printglossary[type=2dlaplace]

The idea of planar Laplace is to generate an area around $x0 \in X$ according to the multivariate Laplace distribution.
The mechanism of planar Laplace is a modification of the Laplace algorithm to support distance \citep{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1212-1984}.
This distance method $dist(x, x_`)$ is defined as the Euclidean distance between two points or sets.
Recalling the definition of Laplace, this method $|x-x_`|$ is replaced by the distance metric.
Hence, the definition of the Probability Density Function (pdf) by Andrés et al. is:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\epsilon^2}{2*\pi}e(-\epsilon d(x_0, x))
\end{equation}
Which is the likelihood a generated point $z \in Z$ is close to $x0$.
The method works for Cartesian coordinates but was modified to support polar coordinates by including $\theta$.
So each point is reflected as $(r, \theta)$ and can be modified by using a slight modification to work for polar Laplace.
A point $z \in Z$ where $z = (r, \theta)$ is randomly generated using two separate methods for calculating $r$ and $\theta$.

  \caption{Representation of the generated $z = {r \theta}$ and original point $x0$.}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Calculating $r$:}
This variable is described as $dist(x_0, z)$ and can be randomly drawn by inverting the CDF (\textbf{Link}) for the Laplace distribution:
\begin{equation}
  C{_\epsilon}{^{-1}}(p) = - \frac{1}{\epsilon}(W_-1 (\frac{p - 1}{e}) + 1)
\end{equation}
For this equation, $W_-1$ is a Lambert W function with -1 branch.
The Lambert w function, also called the product logarithm is defined as $W(x)e^{W(x)} = x$ \citep{lehtonen_lambert_2016}.
The purpose of the Lambert w function is to invert the CDF of the Laplace distribution to generate random noise for one of the coordinates ($r$) using the random value of $p$.

\textbf{Calculating $\theta$:}
The other coordinate ($\theta$) is defined as a random number $[0, 2\pi]$. \newline \newline
To visualize these methods it is necessary to convert the polar coordinates for $z = (r, \theta)$ back to a plane $(x, y)$.
This is described as step 4 of the planar Laplace algorithm \citep{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1212-1984} and visualized using figure \ref{figure:geo}.

  %% If we want to know if a point is within the radius, 
  We highlight the CDF function \todo{Can be moved to appendix} for assessing if the probability of a random point falls between 0 and $r$:
  \begin{equation}
    C{\epsilon}(r) = D_\epsilon,R(p)dp = \int_{0}^{r} 1 - (1 + \epsilon r ) e^{-\epsilon r}
  \end{equation}

\subsection{Truncation} \label{theory:truncation}
Because we have a finite space, it can be possible the perturbed points are off-graph (outside the given domain).
The solution was described in step 5 of the Laplacian mechanism for 2D space. This explains the idea of remapping to the closest admissible location in set A.
For which $A \subset \mathbb{R^2}$, where A is the set of admissible locations \citep{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1212-1984}.
This is also described by chatzikokolakis et al, who also describes a method to do it.
When a perturbed point $z$ is located at the sea or in water, it is easily distinguishable as a fake location.
They introduce a method to check this and efficiently remap to a nearby location.

\subsection{Optimizing for clustering}
The decision of the parameters for the algorithm is straightforward as it depends on the $\epsilon$. \label{paragraph:choosing-r}
This constant is calculated by defining the radius $r$ and the desired level of privacy $l$ and $\epsilon$ is calculated using $l/r$.
The $l$ is a predefined constant $l \in R^+$ but usually will be below 10.
For geographical data, the $r$ can be configured by using meters as a unit of measure.
Therefore, $r = 200$ corresponds to a radius of 200m around point $x_0$.
So, regarding clustering, it is a challenge to define a reasonable radius. \newline
The $\epsilon$ can be considered the inverse unit of $r$ \citep{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1212-1984}.
A radius can be defined per-use case based on how crowded a place is \citep{chatzikokolakis_constructing_2015}.
\todo[inline]{Give the algorithm}

A drawn area as shown in \ref{figure:parea} can be expressed as a perturbation area $P_{area}$ \citep{yan_perturb_2022-2}.
This metric was formulated as:
\begin{equation}
  P_{area}=\left\{ center = x_{0},radius = \frac{1}{N}\times \sum _{i=1}^{N}r_{i}\right\}
\end{equation}
The method loops through each perturbed point $r$ on center $x_0$ (recall \ref{figure:parea}) and calculates the Euclidean distance for an $n$ amount of perturbation points.
Although the method does not contribute to the Laplace algorithm, it is useful for visualization purposes.
