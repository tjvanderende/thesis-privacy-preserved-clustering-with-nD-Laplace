Is also possible to evaluate and measure the impact of the noise between two distributions.
A way to do this is to measure the error between the non-private and private data \cite{del_rey_comprehensive_2020-1}.
Two metrics that are proposed by the same study are Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Average Error (MAE).
Both can be applied to this use-case.
