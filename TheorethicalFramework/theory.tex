\chapter{Literature review}
The current chapter provides an explanation of the theoretical aspects of the research and evaluates similar and previous studies.
First, an explanation is given of the concept of Differential Privacy and its various types.
Next, we examine cluster algorithms and the methods for evaluating their performance.
Regarding the related literature, we first look at studies that have used differential privacy and then the studies that have combined it with cluster methods.
